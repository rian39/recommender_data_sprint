For now though, they have made the grid extremely unstable and if we were to get rid of all of the base load generating plants, brown outs will be a common occurrence. Unless, of course, cities and towns went to micro-grids. Which, in my opinion is the only real functional way to get rid of majority of the coal or nuclear plants. However, most of the people pushing for 60%+ renewables are usually people who know more about Facebook groups than energy sources.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAside from figuring out fusion, energies holy grail.

There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. \n\n  \n\n\nAs I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.\n\n  \n\n\n(This opinion is formed from working as a wind tech, NETA tech, power plant operator/mechanical, and grid assessment tech; as well as two degrees and multiple certificates in power generation)."

    "comment": "&gt; There is absolutely no logical reason that renewables can't be a reasonable and reliable source of energy.\n\nAside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. \n\n  \n\n\nAs I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.\n\n  \n\n\n(This opinion is formed from working as a wind tech, NETA tech, power plant operator/mechanical, and grid assessment tech; as well as two degrees and multiple certificates in power generation)."

There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. \n\n  \n\n\nAs I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.\n\n  \n\n\n(This opinion is formed from working as a wind tech, NETA tech, power plant operator/mechanical, and grid assessment tech; as well as two degrees and multiple certificates in power generation)."

There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. \n\n  \n\n\nAs I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.\n\n  \n\n\n(This opinion is formed from working as a wind tech, NETA tech, power plant operator/mechanical, and grid assessment tech; as well as two degrees and multiple certificates in power generation)."

For now though, they have made the grid extremely unstable and if we were to get rid of all of the base load generating plants, brown outs will be a common occurrence. Unless, of course, cities and towns went to micro-grids. Which, in my opinion is the only real functional way to get rid of majority of the coal or nuclear plants. However, most of the people pushing for 60%+ renewables are usually people who know more about Facebook groups than energy sources.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAside from figuring out fusion, energies holy grail. But even that is being hindered by people who think that flipping a switch *creates* power."

There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. \n\n  \n\n\nAs I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.\n\n  \n\n\n(This opinion is formed from working as a wind tech, NETA tech, power plant operator/mechanical, and grid assessment tech; as well as two degrees and multiple certificates in power generation)."

The bigger problem is distribution (today's grids are not well suited for renewable generation because the plants are at different places) and inflexible fossil plants.\n\nOverproduction can be curtailed or you can use power-to-heat, battery storages or other techniques to use or store the excess electricity. Low production can be compensated by hydro (if you have enough), pumped hydro, batteries, biomass and (natural) gas.\n\nIt might be hard to get 100% renewable electricity, but becoming the major electricity source is not an issue at all."

It expects global demand for oil and gas to be 80-130 million barrels per day by then, up from around 100mb/d today.\n&gt;The company has ambitious plans to grow its oil and gas production 16% by 2025, according to figures compiled by the Norway-based consultants Rystad Energy.\n&gt;The report is gloomy on prospects for avoiding dangerous levels of global warming. The central scenario expects carbon emissions to grow 10% by 2040, as world energy demand grows by a third and fossil fuels continue to play a key role."

Assuming civilisation still exists in a few hundred years, we will most likely still have many uses for hydrocarbons.\n\nEdit: Downvoted for speaking the facts, standard for this place I guess.

Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. \n\n  \n\n\nAs I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.\n\n  \n\n\n(This opinion is formed from working as a wind tech, NETA tech, power plant operator/mechanical, and grid assessment tech; as well as two degrees and multiple certificates in power generation)."

We're already cutting down forests for arable land so **potentially** it could have more of an impact. \n\nThe oil coming out the ground isn't a problem, its when its burnt or its by products end up in our oceans, hydrocarbons we create from crops are just as bad if they end up being dumped into the oceans. Although I guess they could be incinerated which would be carbon neutral.\n\nWe're both just speculating at this point really, we'd need an idea of how much land would be required to produce what we needed, but I imagine it would be considerable."

That's not even considering the initial investment and construction costs that are being passed off to customers. It will be even worse when the subsidies dry up.\n\n  \n\n\nMany people haven't even considered or \"can't be bothered with the fact\" that if majority of energy was generated by renewables it would cost well over $1/kWh in most places and will be severely unstable and inconsistent. Unless, of course, cities and towns switched to micro grids; essentially generating local power for local use. Which would greatly reduce the environment damage caused by large energy storage, transmission, and the \"unseen\" or ignored damage done by creating renewables energy generators (wind/solar) on the current macro scale.\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, the problem with this is that cities/towns would be responsible for generating and maintaining their own power sources."

For now though, they have made the grid extremely unstable and if we were to get rid of all of the base load generating plants, brown outs will be a common occurrence. Unless, of course, cities and towns went to micro-grids. Which, in my opinion is the only real functional way to get rid of majority of the coal or nuclear plants. However, most of the people pushing for 60%+ renewables are usually people who know more about Facebook groups than energy sources.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAside from figuring out fusion, energies holy grail.

There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. \n\n  \n\n\nAs I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.\n\n  \n\n\n(This opinion is formed from working as a wind tech, NETA tech, power plant operator/mechanical, and grid assessment tech; as well as two degrees and multiple certificates in power generation)."

The bigger problem is distribution (today's grids are not well suited for renewable generation because the plants are at different places) and inflexible fossil plants.\n\nOverproduction can be curtailed or you can use power-to-heat, battery storages or other techniques to use or store the excess electricity. Low production can be compensated by hydro (if you have enough), pumped hydro, batteries, biomass and (natural) gas.\n\nIt might be hard to get 100% renewable electricity, but becoming the major electricity source is not an issue at all."

But OPEC fails to point out that the five average rose.  If you look at the 5 year average before 2014 you will see that the glut never went away.\n\nChina and India have both been storing massive quantities of oil in their Strategic Petroleum Reserves.\n\nAll over the world gasoline refining margins are shrinking.  There is definitely a glut of gasoline. I expect US gasoline prices to fall, within the next 6-18 months, to $1 per gallon."

Unless, of course, cities and towns switched to micro grids; essentially generating local power for local use.

The bigger problem is distribution (today's grids are not well suited for renewable generation because the plants are at different places) and inflexible fossil plants.\n\nOverproduction can be curtailed or you can use power-to-heat, battery storages or other techniques to use or store the excess electricity. Low production can be compensated by hydro (if you have enough), pumped hydro, batteries, biomass and (natural) gas.\n\nIt might be hard to get 100% renewable electricity, but becoming the major electricity source is not an issue at all."

That's not even considering the initial investment and construction costs that are being passed off to customers. It will be even worse when the subsidies dry up.\n\n  \n\n\nMany people haven't even considered or \"can't be bothered with the fact\" that if majority of energy was generated by renewables it would cost well over $1/kWh in most places and will be severely unstable and inconsistent. Unless, of course, cities and towns switched to micro grids; essentially generating local power for local use. Which would greatly reduce the environment damage caused by large energy storage, transmission, and the \"unseen\" or ignored damage done by creating renewables energy generators (wind/solar) on the current macro scale.\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, the problem with this is that cities/towns would be responsible for generating and maintaining their own power sources."

When consumption peaks and you need 200% of your usual power, it won't do if the weather decided you'd get 80%.\n\nThe best change that we could hope for in 2040, is changing our daily habits so we can balance out our consumption over the day. Sadly, renewables can never truly work out otherwise, unless we can immensely overproduce the infrastructures to maintain the power need for these 5 minutes everyday, and have a lot of extra during the rest of the day.\n\nScience cannot save our asses forever, we have to make this change by ourselves."

    "comment": "Germany for example has 40% renewable electricity and there was only one single occasion where it produced more renewables than it needed. So overproduction is not an issue. The bigger problem is distribution (today's grids are not well suited for renewable generation because the plants are at different places) and inflexible fossil plants.\n\nOverproduction can be curtailed or you can use power-to-heat, battery storages or other techniques to use or store the excess electricity. Low production can be compensated by hydro (if you have enough), pumped hydro, batteries, biomass and (natural) gas.\n\nIt might be hard to get 100% renewable electricity, but becoming the major electricity source is not an issue at all."

There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. \n\n  \n\n\nAs I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.\n\n  \n\n\n(This opinion is formed from working as a wind tech, NETA tech, power plant operator/mechanical, and grid assessment tech; as well as two degrees and multiple certificates in power generation)."

Assuming civilisation still exists in a few hundred years, we will most likely still have many uses for hydrocarbons.\n\nEdit: Downvoted for speaking the facts, standard for this place I guess. Fact is plastics and their derivatives are amazing materials when used and disposed off correctly. I doubt any of you want to go back to life without them."

Although I guess they could be incinerated which would be carbon neutral.\n\nWe're both just speculating at this point really, we'd need an idea of how much land would be required to produce what we needed, but I imagine it would be considerable."

Unless, of course, cities and towns went to micro-grids. Which, in my opinion is the only real functional way to get rid of majority of the coal or nuclear plants.

There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. \n\n  \n\n\nAs I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.\n\n  \n\n\n(This opinion is formed from working as a wind tech, NETA tech, power plant operator/mechanical, and grid assessment tech; as well as two degrees and multiple certificates in power generation)."

We're already cutting down forests for arable land so **potentially** it could have more of an impact. \n\nThe oil coming out the ground isn't a problem, its when its burnt or its by products end up in our oceans, hydrocarbons we create from crops are just as bad if they end up being dumped into the oceans. Although I guess they could be incinerated which would be carbon neutral.\n\nWe're both just speculating at this point really, we'd need an idea of how much land would be required to produce what we needed, but I imagine it would be considerable."

That's not even considering the initial investment and construction costs that are being passed off to customers. It will be even worse when the subsidies dry up.\n\n  \n\n\nMany people haven't even considered or \"can't be bothered with the fact\" that if majority of energy was generated by renewables it would cost well over $1/kWh in most places and will be severely unstable and inconsistent. Unless, of course, cities and towns switched to micro grids; essentially generating local power for local use. Which would greatly reduce the environment damage caused by large energy storage, transmission, and the \"unseen\" or ignored damage done by creating renewables energy generators (wind/solar) on the current macro scale.\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, the problem with this is that cities/towns would be responsible for generating and maintaining their own power sources."

For now though, they have made the grid extremely unstable and if we were to get rid of all of the base load generating plants, brown outs will be a common occurrence. Unless, of course, cities and towns went to micro-grids. Which, in my opinion is the only real functional way to get rid of majority of the coal or nuclear plants. However, most of the people pushing for 60%+ renewables are usually people who know more about Facebook groups than energy sources.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAside from figuring out fusion, energies holy grail.

There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. \n\n  \n\n\nAs I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.\n\n  \n\n\n(This opinion is formed from working as a wind tech, NETA tech, power plant operator/mechanical, and grid assessment tech; as well as two degrees and multiple certificates in power generation)."

The bigger problem is distribution (today's grids are not well suited for renewable generation because the plants are at different places) and inflexible fossil plants.\n\nOverproduction can be curtailed or you can use power-to-heat, battery storages or other techniques to use or store the excess electricity. Low production can be compensated by hydro (if you have enough), pumped hydro, batteries, biomass and (natural) gas.\n\nIt might be hard to get 100% renewable electricity, but becoming the major electricity source is not an issue at all."

But OPEC fails to point out that the five average rose.  If you look at the 5 year average before 2014 you will see that the glut never went away.\n\nChina and India have both been storing massive quantities of oil in their Strategic Petroleum Reserves.\n\nAll over the world gasoline refining margins are shrinking.  There is definitely a glut of gasoline. I expect US gasoline prices to fall, within the next 6-18 months, to $1 per gallon."

The bigger problem is distribution (today's grids are not well suited for renewable generation because the plants are at different places) and inflexible fossil plants.\n\nOverproduction can be curtailed or you can use power-to-heat, battery storages or other techniques to use or store the excess electricity. Low production can be compensated by hydro (if you have enough), pumped hydro, batteries, biomass and (natural) gas.\n\nIt might be hard to get 100% renewable electricity, but becoming the major electricity source is not an issue at all."

Unless, of course, cities and towns switched to micro grids; essentially generating local power for local use. Which would greatly reduce the environment damage caused by large energy storage, transmission, and the \"unseen\" or ignored damage done by creating renewables energy generators (wind/solar) on the current macro scale.\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, the problem with this is that cities/towns would be responsible for generating and maintaining their own power sources."

Sadly, renewables can never truly work out otherwise, unless we can immensely overproduce the infrastructures to maintain the power need for these 5 minutes everyday, and have a lot of extra during the rest of the day.\n\nScience cannot save our asses forever, we have to make this change by ourselves."

The bigger problem is distribution (today's grids are not well suited for renewable generation because the plants are at different places) and inflexible fossil plants.\n\nOverproduction can be curtailed or you can use power-to-heat, battery storages or other techniques to use or store the excess electricity. Low production can be compensated by hydro (if you have enough), pumped hydro, batteries, biomass and (natural) gas.\n\nIt might be hard to get 100% renewable electricity, but becoming the major electricity source is not an issue at all."

There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. \n\n  \n\n\nAs I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.\n\n  \n\n\n(This opinion is formed from working as a wind tech, NETA tech, power plant operator/mechanical, and grid assessment tech; as well as two degrees and multiple certificates in power generation)."

Assuming civilisation still exists in a few hundred years, we will most likely still have many uses for hydrocarbons.\n\nEdit: Downvoted for speaking the facts, standard for this place I guess. Fact is plastics and their derivatives are amazing materials when used and disposed off correctly. I doubt any of you want to go back to life without them."

The point is to *not* fuck up the Earth even more. \n\n&gt;That number increases to 60,000 years if we take into account seawater extraction which is not economically viable now but may be in the future.\n\nTechnologies exists *right now* that are much closer to being economically viable, that are 100% renewable with no risk of causing radioactive fallout, like solar and wind. Why am I holding out for uranium again? 60,000 years and possible nuclear meltdowns versus clean energy forever? \n\nI'm not against nuclear power, it just makes more logical sense to invest in solar and wind. Nuclear power should be used to power spacecrafts and submarines, not our entire infrastructure."

There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. \n\n  \n\n\nAs I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.\n\n  \n\n\n(This opinion is formed from working as a wind tech, NETA tech, power plant operator/mechanical, and grid assessment tech; as well as two degrees and multiple certificates in power generation)."

We're already cutting down forests for arable land so **potentially** it could have more of an impact. \n\nThe oil coming out the ground isn't a problem, its when its burnt or its by products end up in our oceans, hydrocarbons we create from crops are just as bad if they end up being dumped into the oceans. Although I guess they could be incinerated which would be carbon neutral.\n\nWe're both just speculating at this point really, we'd need an idea of how much land would be required to produce what we needed, but I imagine it would be considerable."

Unless, of course, cities and towns switched to micro grids; essentially generating local power for local use.

In fact, they can have energy payback times as short as 0.8 years in the case of thin-film PV, while also lasting for 30 years or more.\n\nCats kill more birds than wind turbines, hot exhaust from coal and gas plants do, too. Climate change has driven more species to extintion than wind turbines ever will. There's no such thing as a free meal, but at least we could go sustaining ourselves in the least destructive way possible. Next-gen nuclear might cut it, but we have to act now."

For now though, they have made the grid extremely unstable and if we were to get rid of all of the base load generating plants, brown outs will be a common occurrence. Unless, of course, cities and towns went to micro-grids. Which, in my opinion is the only real functional way to get rid of majority of the coal or nuclear plants. However, most of the people pushing for 60%+ renewables are usually people who know more about Facebook groups than energy sources.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAside from figuring out fusion, energies holy grail.

There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. \n\n  \n\n\nAs I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.\n\n  \n\n\n(This opinion is formed from working as a wind tech, NETA tech, power plant operator/mechanical, and grid assessment tech; as well as two degrees and multiple certificates in power generation)."

The bigger problem is distribution (today's grids are not well suited for renewable generation because the plants are at different places) and inflexible fossil plants.\n\nOverproduction can be curtailed or you can use power-to-heat, battery storages or other techniques to use or store the excess electricity. Low production can be compensated by hydro (if you have enough), pumped hydro, batteries, biomass and (natural) gas.\n\nIt might be hard to get 100% renewable electricity, but becoming the major electricity source is not an issue at all."

The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. \n\n  \n\n\nAs I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.\n\n  \n\n\n(This opinion is formed from working as a wind tech, NETA tech, power plant operator/mechanical, and grid assessment tech; as well as two degrees and multiple certificates in power generation)."

The bigger problem is distribution (today's grids are not well suited for renewable generation because the plants are at different places) and inflexible fossil plants.\n\nOverproduction can be curtailed or you can use power-to-heat, battery storages or other techniques to use or store the excess electricity. Low production can be compensated by hydro (if you have enough), pumped hydro, batteries, biomass and (natural) gas.\n\nIt might be hard to get 100% renewable electricity, but becoming the major electricity source is not an issue at all."

The central scenario expects carbon emissions to grow 10% by 2040, as world energy demand grows by a third and fossil fuels continue to play a key role."

The bigger problem is distribution (today's grids are not well suited for renewable generation because the plants are at different places) and inflexible fossil plants.\n\nOverproduction can be curtailed or you can use power-to-heat, battery storages or other techniques to use or store the excess electricity. Low production can be compensated by hydro (if you have enough), pumped hydro, batteries, biomass and (natural) gas.\n\nIt might be hard to get 100% renewable electricity, but becoming the major electricity source is not an issue at all."

Also, the infrastructure won't have to change much more than it already has, in terms of physical transmission and distribution.\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, you are very correct that renewables have caused MWh prices to go up in price drastically due to instability. That's not even considering the initial investment and construction costs that are being passed off to customers. It will be even worse when the subsidies dry up.\n\n  \n\n\nMany people haven't even considered or \"can't be bothered with the fact\" that if majority of energy was generated by renewables it would cost well over $1/kWh in most places and will be severely unstable and inconsistent. Unless, of course, cities and towns switched to micro grids; essentially generating local power for local use. Which would greatly reduce the environment damage caused by large energy storage, transmission, and the \"unseen\" or ignored damage done by creating renewables energy generators (wind/solar) on the current macro scale.\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, the problem with this is that cities/towns would be responsible for generating and maintaining their own power sources."
