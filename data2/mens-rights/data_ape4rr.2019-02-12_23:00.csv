How dare you not allow a woman to use your sperm for her own personal gain? Fucking misogynist.
Its bullshit like this that discourages the real victims to open up about the real issues.
The boy who cried wolf is a perfect example of this and it is completely inappropriate to take advantage of a loophole in the system, especially at the expense of others regardless of the circumstances, if your boyfriend refuses to have a child with you, why not break it off and pursue other men that want to have the kind of life with you? Why do people not do that, because they are ignorant to their own privileges and refuse to work to get what they want.
