It's a bullshit argument though, because of course if it were the other way around and a 17-year-old ""woman"" had sex with her teacher, all of a sudden people would say **""it's just different!""** usually with no farther explanation. But if a 17-year-old girl is too immature to consent, there's no reason a 17-year-old boy wouldn't be also

It's just the same old ignorant stereotypes that boys are sex-crazed perverts who can't be sexually abused, and women are innocent snowflakes who need to be protected, including from the consequences of raping children","On a post about a teacher being sentenced for sexual assault","","https://i.redd.it/j33qu13kr1g21.jpg","i.redd.it","https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/apo5sj/on_a_post_about_a_teacher_being_sentenced_for/?ref=search_posts"

BTW since we see only the title, it isn't clear if they had sex.

They say it takes a man until age 28 to catch up to women, but after that they keep on developing mentally until they die or suffer from a debilitating disease. This is why male village elders throughout history and cultures have always been valued for their wisdom. Also explains why the 30s are the prime years for men.
