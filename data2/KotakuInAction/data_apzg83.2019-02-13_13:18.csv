Obviously I have something to gain from it, so you can take this with a grain of salt, but putting aside my dev hat for a minute I think supporting companies and people with sane beliefs/goals is super important.

A lot of our current power/corporate structure is controlled by people who are vocal about converting our hobbies and society into a reflection of their own ideology. So if you blithely buy products and education from big-name sources it's likely that you're paying for your own opposition.  

The far-left is super diligent about funding anything that props up their ideology and trying to tank anything in opposition, while the center and right try to act more impartial and focus on quality regardless of ideology, which spreads around their support in a less focused way.  There are some success stories like D&amp;C, but it often seems like those are a result of backlash from leftist attacks rather than people searching for and sharing good creators that aren't being attacked.","It's time for new companies/game developers to start rising up.
