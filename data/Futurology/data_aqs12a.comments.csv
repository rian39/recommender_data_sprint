It does not take much skill if you have a knack for writing to create a few lines (like in the OP mentioned) of VERY (!) convincing text, ""news"" etc...even if factually entirely bogus.

So...I can only see that they consider this ""dangerous"" since it would enable foreigners with little grasp of English to do this...but the AI sure can't do something your average writer can't do.

Second, there are currently no true AIs in existence.  It's just machine learning (which is a component of AI, but certainly not the whole enchilada).  Third, we already have fake image, fake video, and fake voice tools which are available in the public domain; why would a fake text generator be so terrifying?  Finally, if the program's predictive algorithms were so good they bordered on prescient, then the government would be all of over it and we'd never have heard a thing--certainly not a ""breaking"" story from The Guardian."

I am a writer, so is this AI ""more dangerous"" than your random lowly paid writer who writes for ""news sites"" like Infowars etc...pulling shit out of their arse? 

Is it more ""dangerous"" than trained/skilled ""Russian"" writers sitting allegedly in St. Petersburg, flooding US social media with made up stories?

REALLY?

It does not take much skill if you have a knack for writing to create a few lines (like in the OP mentioned) of VERY (!) convincing text, ""news"" etc...even if factually entirely bogus.

So...I can only see that they consider this ""dangerous"" since it would enable foreigners with little grasp of English to do this...but the AI sure can't do something your average writer can't do.

I do, for some reason, not agree with withholding this. Why are they even called ""OpenAI""?

The ability to create fake texts, or while we're at it, Deepfakes, and while we're at also the existence of facebook etc. is NOT the problem here..."
"473",68,"AAAYYYyy",14,8,20,2,0,"But with AI you don't need that average writer at all, and you can make 100,000,000,000 believable fake stories/reviews/etc. with very little work. That is what makes it dangerous."

Not only that, I could also make fake websites which look relatively convicing, where I link to these news posts to make it seem even more legit, not just looking like random texts posted on social media with no link anywhere.

This too is done for a long time already by people.

Something must be very ""special"" about this AI that it does something which no writer can do (allegedly), which as I said I highly doubt. I have a feeling there is more to this and that the real reason why it's not released isn't stated. On the other hand, I see WHY, especially now slowly going towards the next elections such a tool in foreign hands would be bad, but it would merely increase the number of ""fake news"" and would make it easier and faster to make them."

&gt; We must leverage out strategic advantages whilst acknowledging capability gaps. Risk management tools and total quality management all those strategic advantages to be highlighted for competitive benchmarking. [and so on and on...]

We got people to try the Kellogg test. Write out your mission statement, inserting ""Kellogg"" wherever your company is named. If it still makes sense, you have a load of flakey and unspecific corn. (Also, put ""not"" in front of every assertive verb - ""we will *not* seek costs control in manufacturing"". If that is obvious nonsense, why say the converse?)

Is it more ""dangerous"" than trained/skilled ""Russian"" writers sitting allegedly in St. Petersburg, flooding US social media with made up stories?

REALLY?

It does not take much skill if you have a knack for writing to create a few lines (like in the OP mentioned) of VERY (!) convincing text, ""news"" etc...even if factually entirely bogus.

So...I can only see that they consider this ""dangerous"" since it would enable foreigners with little grasp of English to do this...but the AI sure can't do something your average writer can't do.

I do, for some reason, not agree with withholding this. Why are they even called ""OpenAI""?

It does not take much skill if you have a knack for writing to create a few lines (like in the OP mentioned) of VERY (!) convincing text, ""news"" etc...even if factually entirely bogus.

So...I can only see that they consider this ""dangerous"" since it would enable foreigners with little grasp of English to do this...but the AI sure can't do something your average writer can't do.

I do, for some reason, not agree with withholding this. Why are they even called ""OpenAI""?

I have heard interviews with some of the OpenAI folks who took pains to point out that the organizations philosophy was for everyone to have open access to the *benefits* of AI, not to make *open source* AI. The idea from the beginning was to recognize that automated learning and decision making could go badly if not handled well, so they want to guarantee it goes well. See [this interview](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/the-world-needs-ai-researchers-heres-how-to-become-one). The key quote, from Dario Amodei is

&gt; I think theres been fair amount of misunderstanding. I think theres one group of people who think its all about open source, and releasing open tools. Theres another set of people who, I dont think many people think this anymore but who for a while thought that it was about making an AGI without any safety precautions and just giving a copy to everyone and that this would somehow solve safety problems. These were too early misconceptions that were around long before I joined OpenAI. My understanding is that its meant to indicate the idea that OpenAI wants the benefits of AI technology to be widely distributed. "

I am a writer, so is this AI ""more dangerous"" than your random lowly paid writer who writes for ""news sites"" like Infowars etc...pulling shit out of their arse? 

Is it more ""dangerous"" than trained/skilled ""Russian"" writers sitting allegedly in St. Petersburg, flooding US social media with made up stories?

REALLY?

It does not take much skill if you have a knack for writing to create a few lines (like in the OP mentioned) of VERY (!) convincing text, ""news"" etc...even if factually entirely bogus.

So...I can only see that they consider this ""dangerous"" since it would enable foreigners with little grasp of English to do this...but the AI sure can't do something your average writer can't do.

I do, for some reason, not agree with withholding this. Why are they even called ""OpenAI""?

I have heard interviews with some of the OpenAI folks who took pains to point out that the organizations philosophy was for everyone to have open access to the *benefits* of AI, not to make *open source* AI. The idea from the beginning was to recognize that automated learning and decision making could go badly if not handled well, so they want to guarantee it goes well. See [this interview](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/the-world-needs-ai-researchers-heres-how-to-become-one). The key quote, from Dario Amodei is

&gt; I think theres been fair amount of misunderstanding. I think theres one group of people who think its all about open source, and releasing open tools. Theres another set of people who, I dont think many people think this anymore but who for a while thought that it was about making an AGI without any safety precautions and just giving a copy to everyone and that this would somehow solve safety problems. These were too early misconceptions that were around long before I joined OpenAI. My understanding is that its meant to indicate the idea that OpenAI wants the benefits of AI technology to be widely distributed. "

I have heard interviews with some of the OpenAI folks who took pains to point out that the organizations philosophy was for everyone to have open access to the *benefits* of AI, not to make *open source* AI. The idea from the beginning was to recognize that automated learning and decision making could go badly if not handled well, so they want to guarantee it goes well. See [this interview](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/the-world-needs-ai-researchers-heres-how-to-become-one). The key quote, from Dario Amodei is

REALLY?

It does not take much skill if you have a knack for writing to create a few lines (like in the OP mentioned) of VERY (!) convincing text, ""news"" etc...even if factually entirely bogus.

So...I can only see that they consider this ""dangerous"" since it would enable foreigners with little grasp of English to do this...but the AI sure can't do something your average writer can't do.

I do, for some reason, not agree with withholding this. Why are they even called ""OpenAI""?

I have heard interviews with some of the OpenAI folks who took pains to point out that the organizations philosophy was for everyone to have open access to the *benefits* of AI, not to make *open source* AI. The idea from the beginning was to recognize that automated learning and decision making could go badly if not handled well, so they want to guarantee it goes well. See [this interview](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/the-world-needs-ai-researchers-heres-how-to-become-one). The key quote, from Dario Amodei is

&gt; I think theres been fair amount of misunderstanding. I think theres one group of people who think its all about open source, and releasing open tools. Theres another set of people who, I dont think many people think this anymore but who for a while thought that it was about making an AGI without any safety precautions and just giving a copy to everyone and that this would somehow solve safety problems. These were too early misconceptions that were around long before I joined OpenAI. My understanding is that its meant to indicate the idea that OpenAI wants the benefits of AI technology to be widely distributed. "

REALLY?

It does not take much skill if you have a knack for writing to create a few lines (like in the OP mentioned) of VERY (!) convincing text, ""news"" etc...even if factually entirely bogus.

So...I can only see that they consider this ""dangerous"" since it would enable foreigners with little grasp of English to do this...but the AI sure can't do something your average writer can't do.

I have heard interviews with some of the OpenAI folks who took pains to point out that the organizations philosophy was for everyone to have open access to the *benefits* of AI, not to make *open source* AI. The idea from the beginning was to recognize that automated learning and decision making could go badly if not handled well, so they want to guarantee it goes well. See [this interview](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/the-world-needs-ai-researchers-heres-how-to-become-one). The key quote, from Dario Amodei is

&gt; I think theres been fair amount of misunderstanding. I think theres one group of people who think its all about open source, and releasing open tools. Theres another set of people who, I dont think many people think this anymore but who for a while thought that it was about making an AGI without any safety precautions and just giving a copy to everyone and that this would somehow solve safety problems. These were too early misconceptions that were around long before I joined OpenAI. My understanding is that its meant to indicate the idea that OpenAI wants the benefits of AI technology to be widely distributed. "

I am a writer, so is this AI ""more dangerous"" than your random lowly paid writer who writes for ""news sites"" like Infowars etc...pulling shit out of their arse? 

Is it more ""dangerous"" than trained/skilled ""Russian"" writers sitting allegedly in St. Petersburg, flooding US social media with made up stories?

REALLY?

It does not take much skill if you have a knack for writing to create a few lines (like in the OP mentioned) of VERY (!) convincing text, ""news"" etc...even if factually entirely bogus.

So...I can only see that they consider this ""dangerous"" since it would enable foreigners with little grasp of English to do this...but the AI sure can't do something your average writer can't do.

I do, for some reason, not agree with withholding this. Why are they even called ""OpenAI""?

The ability to create fake texts, or while we're at it, Deepfakes, and while we're at also the existence of facebook etc. is NOT the problem here..."
"1648",82,"AAAYYYyy",32,8,81,6,0,"But with AI you don't need that average writer at all, and you can make 100,000,000,000 believable fake stories/reviews/etc. with very little work. That is what makes it dangerous."

I have the same feeling. Some articles mentioned they used unsupervised machine learning in the generator. As an AI programmer myself, let me ~~tell you~~ stress that unsupervised machine learning has no valuable place in content generation without a s*t-ton of pre-determined whatnots.

"1657",164,"oliwhail",32,20,81,1,0,"lol the quotes around Russian

I have heard interviews with some of the OpenAI folks who took pains to point out that the organizations philosophy was for everyone to have open access to the *benefits* of AI, not to make *open source* AI. The idea from the beginning was to recognize that automated learning and decision making could go badly if not handled well, so they want to guarantee it goes well. See [this interview](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/the-world-needs-ai-researchers-heres-how-to-become-one). The key quote, from Dario Amodei is

&gt; I think theres been fair amount of misunderstanding. I think theres one group of people who think its all about open source, and releasing open tools. Theres another set of people who, I dont think many people think this anymore but who for a while thought that it was about making an AGI without any safety precautions and just giving a copy to everyone and that this would somehow solve safety problems. These were too early misconceptions that were around long before I joined OpenAI. My understanding is that its meant to indicate the idea that OpenAI wants the benefits of AI technology to be widely distributed. "
