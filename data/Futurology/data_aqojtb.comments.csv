Really there isnt anything inherently wrong with a bunch of small plants instead of a couple large ones.  It would at least be able to match what we currently have.  And it's not like they're binary, you can run one at 1% as easily as at 100%.

You are correct that an advancement in battery technology might come along that won't rely on rare elements like lithium or cobalt, but if it doesn't happen before the demand exceeds supply (which would be less than 10 years if something like the Green New Deal were to pass), then the cost is going to go up.

Finally you mention spending hundreds of billions of dollars on research as the solution. So much for renewables being ""cheaper"", as R&amp;D is a cost like any other.

Surely you're not implying that the energy should be generated in a sunnier state and then transmitted to PA, are you? Do I really need to explain why that isn't remotely practical?

We also have a some wind turbines along the Turnpike here. I've never seen more than one spinning at a time, as this isn't a very windy state either.

In a perfect world that actually valued science and didnt have any political polarization around higher education, unlike the United States, I would say nuclear tech would be the way to go.

You are correct that an advancement in battery technology might come along that won't rely on rare elements like lithium or cobalt, but if it doesn't happen before the demand exceeds supply (which would be less than 10 years if something like the Green New Deal were to pass), then the cost is going to go up.

You are correct that an advancement in battery technology might come along that won't rely on rare elements like lithium or cobalt, but if it doesn't happen before the demand exceeds supply (which would be less than 10 years if something like the Green New Deal were to pass), then the cost is going to go up.

You are correct that an advancement in battery technology might come along that won't rely on rare elements like lithium or cobalt, but if it doesn't happen before the demand exceeds supply (which would be less than 10 years if something like the Green New Deal were to pass), then the cost is going to go up.

You are correct that an advancement in battery technology might come along that won't rely on rare elements like lithium or cobalt, but if it doesn't happen before the demand exceeds supply (which would be less than 10 years if something like the Green New Deal were to pass), then the cost is going to go up.

While they did scram after the earthquake, their plants still needed coolant to maintain non-radioactivity.

If you design the reactor so that when it is scrammed it doesnt need coolant, then it is inherently safe."

"1803",54,"GopherAtl",23,1,1,-1,1,"yaawp. Everyone get all pissed at conservative climate skeptics, but based on their actions, rather than their rhetoric, I'm convinced many of the liberals in politics are just as much climate skeptics as their conservative counterparts. They just cynically see renewable energy as a chance to build their own industrial support base while undermining the oil industry that has long been a support base for conservatives. There's no other explanation for why nuclear is rejected out of hand as a viable option for reducing carbon emissions. "
"1804",55,"runtime_error22",23,1,54,3,0,"""No other reason"", it's called costs. Talk to anyone, anyone at all that's ever worked with FERC, the NRC, or in any kind of Energy Capital market at all. There's a reason no one wants to finance them, and shit like ""modular reactors"" have been a thing for 6-7 years now, but no one trusts them to even work correctly because building nuclear facilities is hard, and what can go wrong usually does in building fuckups and a bottomless pit of costs. If you mention investing into a nuclear facility to anyone with knowledge of capital, you'll get laughed out of the building. It's not just ""regulations"", although we should streamline it a bit, it's the fact revenues and breakevens cannot compete with alternatives. Who's going to flush money down the toilet in opportunity costs? No one. And I actually like nuclear energy, I did a graduate level presentation to a bunch of nerds on the regulatory environment and future of nuclear. There are cool things that need to be worked out, regulation needs to be streamlined, we should OBVIOUSLY continue to look at ways to make nuclear feasible, it can play a big role going forward. But, there are entirely too many people googling ""best case scenarios"" and ignoring what happens in the real world, ignoring costs, and opportunity costs, and in energy that will make or break you completely.

"1805",56,"TylerDurden2022",23,1,54,-4,0,"Yup. Im very skeptical for two main reasons:

- I majored in environmental engineering in school. All my senior level professors were anti-climate alarmists. Theyve actually read the studies and analyzed the data upon which the hysteria is based on. In short: the devil isnt on the details but in the assumptions and models used in those studies.

- If climate alarmists REALLY believed what they preached, ppl like Leo DiCaprio, Al Gore, and Harrison Ford would immediately curb or completely stop jet-setting around the World"

The article actually leans further than I do in that direction - nuclear is far from perfect, and long-term, climate change or not, we should absolutely aspire to 100% renewable. To believe humanity's future depends on drastic reductions of carbon emissions ASAP and then reject nuclear power seems insane to me.

"1816",115,"greivinlopez",23,12,1,-1,0,"There is no reason to think that we can not have both.  The idea of having a single super source of energy is 100 years old.

"1820",132,"AlbertVonMagnus",23,17,131,1,0,"Costa Rica is a tiny nation with insignificant energy requirements that cannot possibly be used as a model for the US. A better comparison would be Germany's incredibly expensive solar investments versus France's nuclear. The latter not only cost a small fraction as much, but resulted in far greater reduction of emissions and lower energy costs. It's hard to argue with results.

Solar will work okay in places that have little infrastructure like Costa Rica. The solar lie is, it's still not as reliable as a power plant. Since the sun doesn't always shine and its ampacity is limited.

Incidentally, I worked for AT&amp;T Bell Labs for over 20 yrs. They're the very company that patented solar panels in the 1950s   "
