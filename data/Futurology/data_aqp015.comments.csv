"236",115,"AliquidExNihilo",9,9,113,1,0,"&gt; There is absolutely no logical reason that renewables can't be a reasonable and reliable source of energy.

Aside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.

Aside from figuring out fusion, energies holy grail. But even that is being hindered by people who think that flipping a switch *creates* power.

  
"
"448",169,"CometoPapal",13,12,168,0,0,"&gt; I'm all for renewables; within reason.

There is absolutely no logical reason that renewables can't be a reasonable and reliable source of energy. I don't understand the hedging. Both things can exist at once, but the eventual goal should be to move completely away from dependency on any kind of limited fuel supply. The sun provides all the energy the world will ever need, and it's just a matter of harnessing it. "
"449",182,"RoutineWillingness",13,13,169,1,0,"Yes, there is a perfectly solid logical reason: they don't work when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. People want reliable and cheap electricity, something these unreliables cannot provide at all."
"450",183,"AliquidExNihilo",13,13,169,0,0,"&gt; There is absolutely no logical reason that renewables can't be a reasonable and reliable source of energy.

Aside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.

Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.

Overproduction can be curtailed or you can use power-to-heat, battery storages or other techniques to use or store the excess electricity. Low production can be compensated by hydro (if you have enough), pumped hydro, batteries, biomass and (natural) gas.

Aside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster.

Aside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.

There is absolutely no logical reason that renewables can't be a reasonable and reliable source of energy. I don't understand the hedging.

Aside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.

Aside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.

There is absolutely no logical reason that renewables can't be a reasonable and reliable source of energy. I don't understand the hedging.

Aside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.

There is absolutely no logical reason that renewables can't be a reasonable and reliable source of energy. I don't understand the hedging.

Aside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.

Aside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.

Aside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster.

Overproduction can be curtailed or you can use power-to-heat, battery storages or other techniques to use or store the excess electricity. Low production can be compensated by hydro (if you have enough), pumped hydro, batteries, biomass and (natural) gas.

It might be hard to get 100% renewable electricity, but becoming the major electricity source is not an issue at all."

Aside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster.

Aside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.

Aside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.

However, you are very correct that renewables have caused MWh prices to go up in price drastically due to instability. That's not even considering the initial investment and construction costs that are being passed off to customers. It will be even worse when the subsidies dry up.

  


Many people haven't even considered or ""can't be bothered with the fact"" that if majority of energy was generated by renewables it would cost well over $1/kWh in most places and will be severely unstable and inconsistent. Unless, of course, cities and towns switched to micro grids; essentially generating local power for local use. Which would greatly reduce the environment damage caused by large energy storage, transmission, and the ""unseen"" or ignored damage done by creating renewables energy generators (wind/solar) on the current macro scale.

Fucking what? Chernobyl, Fukushima, meltdowns happen and they cause so much fallout the sites need to be encased in concrete. Fallout just means nuclear decay.

Aside from figuring out fusion, energies holy grail. But even that is being hindered by people who think that flipping a switch *creates* power.

  
"
"1760",165,"CometoPapal",30,12,164,0,0,"&gt; I'm all for renewables; within reason.

There is absolutely no logical reason that renewables can't be a reasonable and reliable source of energy. I don't understand the hedging. Both things can exist at once, but the eventual goal should be to move completely away from dependency on any kind of limited fuel supply. The sun provides all the energy the world will ever need, and it's just a matter of harnessing it. "
"1761",166,"RoutineWillingness",30,12,165,1,0,"Yes, there is a perfectly solid logical reason: they don't work when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. People want reliable and cheap electricity, something these unreliables cannot provide at all."

"1763",167,"AliquidExNihilo",30,12,165,0,0,"&gt; There is absolutely no logical reason that renewables can't be a reasonable and reliable source of energy.

Aside from the fact that they're not reliable, and to produce them on the scale you're implying would also be extremely detrimental to the environment. There's no logical reason that anyone who understands how electricity is generated would solely depend on renewable energy, or not want at minimum a couple nuclear power plants for base load for when there's a cloud or no wind. Anyone who has any idea of how the electrical grid functions would understand the volatility of renewables. The debate isn't if the sun can provide it, it's at what cost (to the earth and the grid) are we willing to depend on it. 

  


As I said it's plausible to have majority of energy come from renewables only if cities and towns switched to microgrids. However, relying on renewables on a macro scale, in our current infrastructure, is begging for disaster. Your response is just another example of someone debating an idea that they don't know much about.
