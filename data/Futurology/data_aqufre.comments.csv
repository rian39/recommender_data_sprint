"49",14,"_Z_E_R_O",3,2,13,1,0,"Because its quicker, cheaper, and easier to do fertility treatments than it is to adopt a kid.

Foster care adoptions can be fast and cheap but have a lot of red tape and a high failure rate. Not only that, but kids in foster care are much more likely to have psychological problems or developmental delays stemming from abuse or drug exposure. 

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail. And thats just for domestic adoptions. If you adopt internationally youd better have $20,000+ saved up in your bank account and be prepared to deal with a foreign court system. "
"50",34,"Mindraker",3,3,14,1,0,"&gt; cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front

Sounds like someone's making a lot of money."
"51",35,"_Z_E_R_O",3,3,34,1,0,"Yep, the agency. Consider though that they provide a lot of services. They match potential parents with the birth mothers, facilitate communication, provide legal protection and guidance, and serve as an intermediary between all parties. 

I would never recommend that anyone adopt outside of an agency or the foster care system. Ive known two people that have handled adoptions on their own, and both had very bad outcomes. "
"52",36,"kyoto_kinnuku",3,3,34,1,0,"I imagine taking care of those kids isnt cheap though...  If its a private foster home it sounds like theyre paying a lot of those costs out of pocket....no?"
"53",37,"Imadethosehitmanguns",3,3,34,1,0,"Also sounds like a good way for most kids to go unadopted."
"54",38,"papadanku42",3,3,14,1,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ? 

In response to the money aspect:

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

It makes sense to me that agencies would double check that people can afford a kid before giving them one. Same goes for the home inspection. "
"55",39,"_Z_E_R_O",3,3,38,1,0,"It makes a lot of sense, yes. I never said agencies were a bad thing. I have an adopted sibling, and my family went through an agency and had a good outcome.

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"56",40,"Cunt_Bag",3,3,13,1,0,"It's not just DNA, it's also the physical pregnancy that some women want to experience. It's a deeply personal, uniquely female experience, and I don't think we should ridicule women who want to have that for themselves. "
"57",41,"papadanku42",3,3,40,1,0,"I don't personally understand why someone would choose this route instead of adoption or something similar but that doesn't mean I think it's funny..."
"58",42,"Thirtytwotwenty",3,3,41,1,0,"Especially since the transplant of this non-vital organ means she had to be on immunosuppressive medications for the rest of her life... unless she wants that womb to rot out of her. "
"59",43,"kyoto_kinnuku",3,3,42,1,0,"Or just remove it post pregnancy?"
"60",44,"Ossidjana",3,3,40,1,0,"As a woman, I feel deeply disgusted by this experience and I consider it pure selfishness. Its of another life were talkig about, how can you possibly feel alright knowing that you have decided for the life of somebody else only because you wanted that damned (and awful) bump?"
"61",45,"AM_Kylearan",3,3,13,1,0,"Because people can do what they want.  If you want, go adopt kids.  It's your right."
"62",46,"papadanku42",3,3,45,1,0,"Totally agree. Just because I don't understand doesn't mean I want to ban anyone who disagrees with me. "
"63",47,"megaOga27",3,3,13,1,0,"I can understand it, I find it crazy that since the begining of humanity, the adn of my family is passed from generation to generation. If I could not break that, I would."
"64",48,"Prinzini",3,3,47,1,0,"how do you know there wasn't an adoption in your lineage somewhere down the line?"
"65",49,"megaOga27",3,3,48,1,0,"It doesn't change anything in my statements. 
The genes of my genetical family are still passed by me if I have children in the future "
"66",50,"Prinzini",3,3,49,1,0,"I just mean that it's likely to have been broken many many times since the beginning of humanity anyway, so it's not like you would be doing the universe a disservice"
"67",51,"megaOga27",3,3,50,1,0,"It's not broken, it's passed. Adopted or not I still come from a women and a Man. As long as I have children with my own sperm I won't break it either  even if i don't raise the children in question .

In your hypothesis the only genetical heritage lost is the one from the person that adopted my supposely adopted ancestor (if this person didn't have any other children)"
"68",52,"Prinzini",3,3,51,1,0,"that's exactly what I mean yeah, and statistically it's likely to have happened a lot since the dawn of humanity"
"69",53,"Kaagareth",3,3,48,1,0,"Adopted from Mars?"
"70",54,"papadanku42",3,3,47,1,1,"Idk I feel like you should have kids because you love them and want to give your best to raise them into good people, not to pass on your DNA or ""legacy"" or whatever... those reasons just seem selfish to me "
"71",55,"megaOga27",3,3,54,1,0,"Well both seems to be perfectly legit.

In this case, in your opinion , people should just adopt even if they can have babies ?"
"72",56,"papadanku42",3,3,55,1,0,"I think everyone should do what is right for them. In my personal opinion, you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. Not for your own personal gain alone, like for social status or passing on genes. "
"73",57,"depression_is_fun",3,3,56,1,0,"Nail on the fucking head. Having a kid just for personal gain is selfish as fuck."
"74",58,"megaOga27",3,3,56,1,0,"Well passing genes isn't the first reason of course the both options are more than compatible, no need to question.

But personnaly would you rather have a baby from you or adopt a baby ?"
"75",59,"papadanku42",3,3,58,1,0,"I think questioning our beliefs every now and again is a very healthy thing to do. Would you rather have a biological child or adopt one ? 

Personally, I'd rather have no baby at all."
"76",60,"fonduman",3,3,54,1,0,"You want to successfully raise kids for the same reasons - successful genetic propagation"
"77",61,"JustsomeOKCguy",3,3,54,1,0,"The adoption process is really brutal. Especially in America. And fostering can require a lot out of a person.

Even then. Babies cost a lot of money and change your life to completely support this new individual. Seems like the exact opposite of selfish to me"
"78",62,"hilly4rilly",3,3,13,1,0,"I agree, but also, do you really want to roll the dice? Having a kid, I'm assuming, is a very rewarding experience and life-changing according to those who have kids (I don't, so I don't know). "
"79",63,"papadanku42",3,3,62,1,0,"Roll the dice in what aspect ? "
"80",64,"hilly4rilly",3,3,63,1,0,"I know a foster family that adopted a crack-baby and autistic child, which is great.  The issue is that it's a lot of work, there's psychological and dependancy issues with the crack-baby and if you don't have the money to deal with those issues, they compound.  It's just riskier than having your own kid in terms of issues that the child could have.  "
"81",65,"Black_RL",3,3,13,1,0,"Because my DNA, not theirs.

Not saying I agree, just giving an answer.

Edit: sorry I used Portuguese ADN, its obviously DNA."
"82",66,"papadanku42",3,3,65,1,0,"Your Anime Digital Network...? "
"83",67,"LordAlfrey",3,3,66,1,0,"That's the only answer to that (FACT)"
"84",68,"Swatterbuster",3,3,13,1,0,"I think there's a strong evolutionary desire to have your own children in some people. The same way some people absolutely need to be parents and will never feel fulfilled if they can't be. "
"85",69,"vangoghism",3,3,13,1,0,"Adopting and fostering can be much different experiences than having your own child.  They are also not easy or free.  It can be very complicated.  I've been looking into all of the above in the last year for our family and it's just not that simple, at least not in my opinion.  I've never experienced such deep heartbreak as I have from miscarriages and infertility problems over the past 8 years.  Just adopting or fostering doesn't fix that and can potentially come with many more challenges that a couple with their own children never have to deal with.  It's just not an either/or situation for most people.  Maybe you are one of those wonderful people who have adopted and fostered children and that's why you don't understand? If you are not, I recommend being more sensitive to what others may be going through."
"86",70,"fonduman",3,3,13,1,0,"Because organisms who applied the same kind of valuation to random kids vs their own were selected against for millions of years, ingraining a strong bias towards the product of one's own genetics. "
"87",71,"vilimus-",3,3,13,1,0,"This is the good take. Adopting is the only ethical way to have children. If you adopt, you have done good for one person. If you birth, you have missed the opportunity to adopt (bad) and you have created a new life without consent (children can't consent to be born). Therefore birthing is net bad, and adopting is net good."
"88",72,"Mid-thirties_Gambino",3,3,13,1,0,"I can never understand wanting to be a genetic dead after thousands of years of human struggle and fighting off nature. 

Countless generations have struggled just to procreate to ensure their genetic line continues and you allow some low grade malaise to wipe away all of that work that led to you existing. 

You dont deserve to be here. "
"89",73,"papadanku42",3,3,72,1,0,"So you're saying anyone unable or unwilling to have biological kids doesn't deserve to live? I'm gonna have to disagree with you. "
"90",74,"M4dmaddy",3,3,72,1,0,"I consider the values and beliefs I can pass onto a child to be a thousandfold more important than my genetic material.

Foster care adoptions can be fast and cheap but have a lot of red tape and a high failure rate. Not only that, but kids in foster care are much more likely to have psychological problems or developmental delays stemming from abuse or drug exposure. 

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail. And thats just for domestic adoptions. If you adopt internationally youd better have $20,000+ saved up in your bank account and be prepared to deal with a foreign court system. "

In response to the money aspect:

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

It makes sense to me that agencies would double check that people can afford a kid before giving them one. Same goes for the home inspection. "
"195",146,"_Z_E_R_O",4,4,145,1,0,"It makes a lot of sense, yes. I never said agencies were a bad thing. I have an adopted sibling, and my family went through an agency and had a good outcome.

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"196",147,"papadanku42",4,4,146,1,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "

"261",212,"hilly4rilly",4,4,211,1,0,"I know a foster family that adopted a crack-baby and autistic child, which is great.  The issue is that it's a lot of work, there's psychological and dependancy issues with the crack-baby and if you don't have the money to deal with those issues, they compound.  It's just riskier than having your own kid in terms of issues that the child could have.  "

Human observation: people prefer to birth their own kids than adopt others'. This can be taken as a given, because it's the premise of your question.  
  
Possible explanation: selection against those who don't show such a preference, due to gene propagation advantage.  
  
Penguin observation: some individuals adopt other baby penguins (note: what frequency? And does this comprise a preference, or merely an existent behaviour?)  
  
So in this case we could have a different explanation based on a different observation. For instance, off the top of my head, I know penguins depend a lot on others for body heat, so the survival of the group as a whole may have been a stronger selective pressure than more directly selfish ones. "

Observation: Humans and Penguins prefer to birth their own children but some individuals adopt children
Explanation: Adopting children is beneficial for the society that humans and penguins live in

We could draw hundreds of different hypothetical conclusions from our observations. This is why I asked for a source for the claim you were making that the will to adopt has somehow been genetically selected out of humans. If this were true, then the will to adopt a child must be genetic (since you stated it could be selected for) and we would be able to prove this. 

Most mammals can't choose to have biological children. They have primitive urges to have sex, and when they become pregnant they bear children. Sure, some may abandon, kill or eat those offspring, but most do not. 

In my opinion, humans have evolved into sentient beings with the ability to choose to have biological children (contraception, abortion, adoption, etc.) Are we just slaves to our primitive urges to have sex and kids? It is really more of a philosophical question as to why someone would want a biological child and I don't think there is any one answer to this question. "

Foster care adoptions can be fast and cheap but have a lot of red tape and a high failure rate. Not only that, but kids in foster care are much more likely to have psychological problems or developmental delays stemming from abuse or drug exposure. 

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

In response to the money aspect:

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

It makes sense to me that agencies would double check that people can afford a kid before giving them one. Same goes for the home inspection. "
"461",338,"_Z_E_R_O",5,5,337,27,0,"It makes a lot of sense, yes. I never said agencies were a bad thing. I have an adopted sibling, and my family went through an agency and had a good outcome.

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"462",339,"papadanku42",5,5,338,8,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "

Human observation: people prefer to birth their own kids than adopt others'. This can be taken as a given, because it's the premise of your question.  
  
Possible explanation: selection against those who don't show such a preference, due to gene propagation advantage.  
  
Penguin observation: some individuals adopt other baby penguins (note: what frequency? And does this comprise a preference, or merely an existent behaviour?)  
  
So in this case we could have a different explanation based on a different observation. For instance, off the top of my head, I know penguins depend a lot on others for body heat, so the survival of the group as a whole may have been a stronger selective pressure than more directly selfish ones. "

Observation: Humans and Penguins prefer to birth their own children but some individuals adopt children

We could draw hundreds of different hypothetical conclusions from our observations. This is why I asked for a source for the claim you were making that the will to adopt has somehow been genetically selected out of humans. If this were true, then the will to adopt a child must be genetic (since you stated it could be selected for) and we would be able to prove this. 

Most mammals can't choose to have biological children. They have primitive urges to have sex, and when they become pregnant they bear children. Sure, some may abandon, kill or eat those offspring, but most do not. 

In my opinion, humans have evolved into sentient beings with the ability to choose to have biological children (contraception, abortion, adoption, etc.) Are we just slaves to our primitive urges to have sex and kids?

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

"787",339,"papadanku42",6,5,338,13,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "

Human observation: people prefer to birth their own kids than adopt others'. This can be taken as a given, because it's the premise of your question.  
  
Possible explanation: selection against those who don't show such a preference, due to gene propagation advantage.  
  
Penguin observation: some individuals adopt other baby penguins (note: what frequency? And does this comprise a preference, or merely an existent behaviour?)  
  
So in this case we could have a different explanation based on a different observation. For instance, off the top of my head, I know penguins depend a lot on others for body heat, so the survival of the group as a whole may have been a stronger selective pressure than more directly selfish ones. "

Observation: Humans and Penguins prefer to birth their own children but some individuals adopt children
Explanation: Adopting children is beneficial for the society that humans and penguins live in

We could draw hundreds of different hypothetical conclusions from our observations. This is why I asked for a source for the claim you were making that the will to adopt has somehow been genetically selected out of humans. If this were true, then the will to adopt a child must be genetic (since you stated it could be selected for) and we would be able to prove this. 

Most mammals can't choose to have biological children. They have primitive urges to have sex, and when they become pregnant they bear children. Sure, some may abandon, kill or eat those offspring, but most do not. 

In my opinion, humans have evolved into sentient beings with the ability to choose to have biological children (contraception, abortion, adoption, etc.) Are we just slaves to our primitive urges to have sex and kids? It is really more of a philosophical question as to why someone would want a biological child and I don't think there is any one answer to this question. "

I understand the argument no one can force you to have a child.  I've never been able to understand when it goes in this direction though."
"924",662,"Jonathan_Sessions",6,6,661,1,0,"Not existing is a neutral state.  You can't feel or experience anything if you don't exsist.  It's not good or bad.

Being an unwanted person is mostly bad."
"925",663,"Saphibella",6,6,661,1,0,"Well I understand that you struggle with it, because it is a very very difficult subject with a lot of different viewpoints.

And of course there is also a difference between using preventative methods during sex, which should definitely be the preferred method of preventing pregnancy, and abortion, which should be the no other way out method. But that does not mean that people should be shamed by using either method, or that it should be a taboo.

But we also have to accept that if a society is for life of a foetus/child no matter what, then there are some responsibilities that follow, which we just have to be clear about, because if those responsibilities are shunned, it is the children that suffer in the end, and is no existence better than a life full of suffering from start to finish?

If children which could be prevented, now have been put on Earth, they need to be taken care of, and they should ideally be the responsibility of the parents that gave them life. 

But then there is the responsibility of a society that gets to decide how people should behave through policy of no sex education, telling teenagers that abstinence is the only method, as well as shaming women from getting abortions. 

So such a society should have a system that ensure that these children are taken care of. Be that through supporting parents economically to ensure that the children get food, go to school, get an education, and succeed at becoming well balanced citizens. Or through a more efficient adoption and foster care system that makes it easier for people both willing to give their child up for adoption, as well as the people willing to adopt children.

That is just not the reality observed in the US, where fertility methods are shunned, and not made readily available, that is where my problem is. You either accept the consequences of your ethical reality as a society, or make the methods to control fertility readily available, so that people can decide for themselves how they want to behave.


America in a nutshell, is that the children have become a societal issue, as long as they are in the womb, but when they get out, society shuns the responsibility of them growing up into well functioning people and well balanced citizens.

There are 4 general pelvic shapes:

android (most common male shape, narrowed diameters, poor for vaginal birth)

gynecoid (most common female shape, wide diameters, great for vaginal birth)

platypelloid (wide side to side, narrow front to back, and poor for vaginal birth)

anthropoid (ok for vaginal birth, but more likely to result in a sunny side up delivery)


During later pregnancy, hormones loosen up pelvic ligaments, but even with that additional ""give"", unless the infant is small or premature, vaginal birth is unlikely for the android or platypelloid shapes.

"1105",773,"Murgie",7,7,772,1,0,"A c-section is already the only option when using a transplanted womb, so it's really not much of a concern. 

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article. It doesn't apply to this situation, because here we know that the change came about as a result of the drastic change in environmental conditions the cells are being exposed to, and that said conditions are obviously non-carcinogenic in nature."

&gt;It is possible for a mothers red blood cells to cross into the placenta or fetus during pregnancy. When this occurs, the mothers blood cells develop antibodies that can attack the newborns blood cells and cause jaundice. ... If an Rh incompatibility is found, an Rh-immune globulin treatment is administered about 28 weeks into the pregnancy.

This is only a risk for rhesus negative mothers carrying rhesus positive babies. If its the other way round or both are the same there is no issue.

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

In response to the money aspect:

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

It makes sense to me that agencies would double check that people can afford a kid before giving them one. Same goes for the home inspection. "

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"1181",833,"papadanku42",7,7,832,12,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "

Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

Penguin observation: some individuals adopt other baby penguins (note: what frequency? And does this comprise a preference, or merely an existent behaviour?)

We could draw hundreds of different hypothetical conclusions from our observations. This is why I asked for a source for the claim you were making that the will to adopt has somehow been genetically selected out of humans. If this were true, then the will to adopt a child must be genetic (since you stated it could be selected for) and we would be able to prove this. 

Most mammals can't choose to have biological children. They have primitive urges to have sex, and when they become pregnant they bear children. Sure, some may abandon, kill or eat those offspring, but most do not. 

In my opinion, humans have evolved into sentient beings with the ability to choose to have biological children (contraception, abortion, adoption, etc.) Are we just slaves to our primitive urges to have sex and kids? It is really more of a philosophical question as to why someone would want a biological child and I don't think there is any one answer to this question. "
"1242",889,"fonduman",7,7,888,1,0,"&gt; This is why I asked for a source for the claim you were making that the will to adopt has somehow been genetically selected out of humans

I never said we don't want to adopt. Actually, it's even a bit of a misnomer for me to have said we even *prefer* to birth than adopt.  
  
Think of it this way: we have an urge to drink, and an urge to eat. Both obviously serve a role to maintaining life and anything that lacks these urges will take itself out of the gene pool pretty quickly. But, they're separate urges. If someone is hungry, you can't wonder why they don't just drink more to make up for it, or vice versa. Point being, people may like to adopt (well, some of them), but it's invalid to say that they should adopt *instead* of birthing their own children, because they potentially address different instinctual drives.  
  
&gt; humans have evolved into sentient beings

Well, technically all mammals etc are sentient. Self-awareness/sapience is probably what you mean here.  
  
&gt; Are we just slaves to our primitive urges to have sex and kids?

Our urges determine what we want, and we generally try to get what we want, unless there's a reason not to. E.g. a primitive urge is to urinate, but we can consciously resist this urge until a more convenient time, when needed. So, people could consciously decide to adopt instead of giving birth, but they often choose not to. The original question asked why this is, and I responded by essentially saying that it's because they don't want to, and that's probably due to said primitive urges. Evidently, these people don't find the benefits of adoption to be significant enough to outweigh the fulfillment of their primitive urges that they get when birthing their own offspring.

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt.

"
"1345",969,"Saphibella",7,7,966,1,0,"Well I understand that you struggle with it, because it is a very very difficult subject with a lot of different viewpoints.

And of course there is also a difference between using preventative methods during sex, which should definitely be the preferred method of preventing pregnancy, and abortion, which should be the no other way out method. But that does not mean that people should be shamed by using either method, or that it should be a taboo.

But we also have to accept that if a society is for life of a foetus/child no matter what, then there are some responsibilities that follow, which we just have to be clear about, because if those responsibilities are shunned, it is the children that suffer in the end, and is no existence better than a life full of suffering from start to finish?

If children which could be prevented, now have been put on Earth, they need to be taken care of, and they should ideally be the responsibility of the parents that gave them life. 

But then there is the responsibility of a society that gets to decide how people should behave through policy of no sex education, telling teenagers that abstinence is the only method, as well as shaming women from getting abortions. 

So such a society should have a system that ensure that these children are taken care of. Be that through supporting parents economically to ensure that the children get food, go to school, get an education, and succeed at becoming well balanced citizens. Or through a more efficient adoption and foster care system that makes it easier for people both willing to give their child up for adoption, as well as the people willing to adopt children.

That is just not the reality observed in the US, where fertility methods are shunned, and not made readily available, that is where my problem is. You either accept the consequences of your ethical reality as a society, or make the methods to control fertility readily available, so that people can decide for themselves how they want to behave.


America in a nutshell, is that the children have become a societal issue, as long as they are in the womb, but when they get out, society shuns the responsibility of them growing up into well functioning people and well balanced citizens.

"
"1346",970,"Murgie",7,7,966,1,0,"&gt;Where does the ethic that not existing is better than being an unwanted child come from? I'm just interested in the rationale because that one's always eluded me. 

It's exactly the same rationale behind every single sperm or egg cell that you produce and do not actively attempt to make into a child, mate. 

Like, nonexistence isn't an *alternative* state of being that can be thought of as better or worse than other possible states. Rather, it's the absence of one altogether.  "
"1347",971,"NoahPM",7,7,970,1,0,"But obviously at *some point* something stops being nonexistence and becomes putting an end to existence.  And obviously that doesn't remedy the awkwardness in feeling bad for an unwanted child and saying it would be better for him/her if they didn't exist.  There's merit to the argument that you would vouch for every existing unwanted child's existence when considering what you should do with a 3 pound bundle of cells in the shape of a human being sitting inside of a mother that doesn't want it.  As long as your insisting it's for the child's benefit, that argument is relevant.

It just irks me because I see people calling pro-life people hypocrites because I guess something about being pro-life means you're against adoption too or child welfare, while the pro-choice crowd tries to express the hypocritical sentiment that it's better for the child to not be brought into this world while admitting it's a good thing an unwanted child was born.  You have to suggest it's bad that the child was born in the first place for this to be logically consistent.  Again, so long as your argument for abortion is that it's for the child's benefit, which I'm aware isn't the only argument for abortion but a weird one indeed.

When artificial wombs become a thing I will gladly be against abortion while admitting I have no idea if I would be for or against it (ethically/philosophically, not legally) if they didn't exist."

So what you're saying is that you *aren't* actually aware of a single instance in which eggs have been harvested for use in reproduction.

And you know why? It's because that's not what they're used for. 

Eggs harvested from deceased organ donors are almost exclusively used in medical experiments to determine whether experimental medications and the like have the potential to harm or kill non-fertilized eggs. They're also used in similar experiments, such as testing different methods of keeping the cells alive for the purposes of long-term egg storage. 

Frankly, the wild conclusions you've drawn on the basis of *not* being correct by some poor phone-line operator who you seem to believe holds an MD is downright embarrassing. 

If you've got the time to spout misinformation, then you've got the time to do some actual research to see whether the fantasies you've spun hold up to basic scrutiny. "

"1501",517,"skyman724",8,6,322,1,0,"&gt;ego-based desire for the woman to give birth

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."
"1502",1025,"sewsewsewyourboat",8,8,322,1,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand.

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

platypelloid (wide side to side, narrow front to back, and poor for vaginal birth)

anthropoid (ok for vaginal birth, but more likely to result in a sunny side up delivery)


During later pregnancy, hormones loosen up pelvic ligaments, but even with that additional ""give"", unless the infant is small or premature, vaginal birth is unlikely for the android or platypelloid shapes.

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"1617",1056,"papadanku42",8,8,1055,14,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them.

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "

Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

Penguin observation: some individuals adopt other baby penguins (note: what frequency? And does this comprise a preference, or merely an existent behaviour?)

We could draw hundreds of different hypothetical conclusions from our observations.

If this were true, then the will to adopt a child must be genetic (since you stated it could be selected for) and we would be able to prove this. 

Most mammals can't choose to have biological children. They have primitive urges to have sex, and when they become pregnant they bear children. Sure, some may abandon, kill or eat those offspring, but most do not. 

In my opinion, humans have evolved into sentient beings with the ability to choose to have biological children (contraception, abortion, adoption, etc.) Are we just slaves to our primitive urges to have sex and kids?

Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."

No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child.

I understand the argument no one can force you to have a child.  I've never been able to understand when it goes in this direction though."
"1770",1174,"Saphibella",8,8,1173,2,0,"Well I understand that you struggle with it, because it is a very very difficult subject with a lot of different viewpoints.

And of course there is also a difference between using preventative methods during sex, which should definitely be the preferred method of preventing pregnancy, and abortion, which should be the no other way out method. But that does not mean that people should be shamed by using either method, or that it should be a taboo.

But we also have to accept that if a society is for life of a foetus/child no matter what, then there are some responsibilities that follow, which we just have to be clear about, because if those responsibilities are shunned, it is the children that suffer in the end, and is no existence better than a life full of suffering from start to finish?

If children which could be prevented, now have been put on Earth, they need to be taken care of, and they should ideally be the responsibility of the parents that gave them life. 

But then there is the responsibility of a society that gets to decide how people should behave through policy of no sex education, telling teenagers that abstinence is the only method, as well as shaming women from getting abortions. 

So such a society should have a system that ensure that these children are taken care of. Be that through supporting parents economically to ensure that the children get food, go to school, get an education, and succeed at becoming well balanced citizens. Or through a more efficient adoption and foster care system that makes it easier for people both willing to give their child up for adoption, as well as the people willing to adopt children.

That is just not the reality observed in the US, where fertility methods are shunned, and not made readily available, that is where my problem is. You either accept the consequences of your ethical reality as a society, or make the methods to control fertility readily available, so that people can decide for themselves how they want to behave.


America in a nutshell, is that the children have become a societal issue, as long as they are in the womb, but when they get out, society shuns the responsibility of them growing up into well functioning people and well balanced citizens.

It's exactly the same rationale behind every single sperm or egg cell that you produce and do not actively attempt to make into a child, mate. 

Like, nonexistence isn't an *alternative* state of being that can be thought of as better or worse than other possible states. Rather, it's the absence of one altogether.  "
"1774",1178,"NoahPM",8,8,1177,1,0,"But obviously at *some point* something stops being nonexistence and becomes putting an end to existence.  And obviously that doesn't remedy the awkwardness in feeling bad for an unwanted child and saying it would be better for him/her if they didn't exist.  There's merit to the argument that you would vouch for every existing unwanted child's existence when considering what you should do with a 3 pound bundle of cells in the shape of a human being sitting inside of a mother that doesn't want it.  As long as your insisting it's for the child's benefit, that argument is relevant.

It just irks me because I see people calling pro-life people hypocrites because I guess something about being pro-life means you're against adoption too or child welfare, while the pro-choice crowd tries to express the hypocritical sentiment that it's better for the child to not be brought into this world while admitting it's a good thing an unwanted child was born.  You have to suggest it's bad that the child was born in the first place for this to be logically consistent.  Again, so long as your argument for abortion is that it's for the child's benefit, which I'm aware isn't the only argument for abortion but a weird one indeed.

So what you're saying is that you *aren't* actually aware of a single instance in which eggs have been harvested for use in reproduction.

And you know why? It's because that's not what they're used for. 

Eggs harvested from deceased organ donors are almost exclusively used in medical experiments to determine whether experimental medications and the like have the potential to harm or kill non-fertilized eggs. They're also used in similar experiments, such as testing different methods of keeping the cells alive for the purposes of long-term egg storage. 

Frankly, the wild conclusions you've drawn on the basis of *not* being correct by some poor phone-line operator who you seem to believe holds an MD is downright embarrassing.

I think for eggs to be viable, you need to either be ovulating or taking a ton of medicine. Dormant eggs can't be used to make babies as far as I know, they need to mature to a point which is what happens in the weeks prior to ovulation. 

I could be wrong and I'd love for someone more knowledgeable to come correct me, but as far as I know if you donated your body/reproductive organs there would be no way they could use your eggs to make more babies."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand.

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

gynecoid (most common female shape, wide diameters, great for vaginal birth)

platypelloid (wide side to side, narrow front to back, and poor for vaginal birth)

anthropoid (ok for vaginal birth, but more likely to result in a sunny side up delivery)


During later pregnancy, hormones loosen up pelvic ligaments, but even with that additional ""give"", unless the infant is small or premature, vaginal birth is unlikely for the android or platypelloid shapes.

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

&gt;It is possible for a mothers red blood cells to cross into the placenta or fetus during pregnancy. When this occurs, the mothers blood cells develop antibodies that can attack the newborns blood cells and cause jaundice. ... If an Rh incompatibility is found, an Rh-immune globulin treatment is administered about 28 weeks into the pregnancy. If the incompatibility is not detected, the newborn can develop severe jaundice leading to brain damage. "

Her immune system may then start to produce antibodies. Its her antibodies that can cross the placenta during a subsequent pregnancy. 

This is only a risk for rhesus negative mothers carrying rhesus positive babies. If its the other way round or both are the same there is no issue. We dont normally know what the babys blood group is so all rhesus negative mothers should receive anti D at 28 weeks. If the baby is rhesus positive they get another dose after the birth. "

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

"2059",1261,"papadanku42",9,9,1260,13,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "

Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

Youre easily looking at $40-50,000, a very invasive and humilating application process, and a multi year wait. 

Adoption is a valid option that I wish more people undertook but its not as easily as just taking a trip down to the kid store. "
"2088",1286,"papadanku42",9,9,956,-1,1,"Thank you for your opinion. Through the research I've done, I learned that childbirth and adoption cost around the same in the USA; both anywhere from $10,000-30,000 on average (obviously this varies depending on the situation). See my previous comment for sources. 

In my opinion, it is a good thing that people are thoroughly vetted and there is a waiting period, rather than being able to ""just take a trip down to the kid store"" and immediately receive a kid. Could you elaborate more and the 'humiliating application process' ? 

Edit: not sure why people are downvoting this. If you disagree I'd love to hear your opinion. Also gonna explain a bit further:


Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."

I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar.

Penguin observation: some individuals adopt other baby penguins (note: what frequency? And does this comprise a preference, or merely an existent behaviour?)

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice.

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."

"
"2216",1375,"Saphibella",9,9,1372,2,0,"Well I understand that you struggle with it, because it is a very very difficult subject with a lot of different viewpoints.

And of course there is also a difference between using preventative methods during sex, which should definitely be the preferred method of preventing pregnancy, and abortion, which should be the no other way out method. But that does not mean that people should be shamed by using either method, or that it should be a taboo.

But we also have to accept that if a society is for life of a foetus/child no matter what, then there are some responsibilities that follow, which we just have to be clear about, because if those responsibilities are shunned, it is the children that suffer in the end, and is no existence better than a life full of suffering from start to finish?

If children which could be prevented, now have been put on Earth, they need to be taken care of, and they should ideally be the responsibility of the parents that gave them life. 

But then there is the responsibility of a society that gets to decide how people should behave through policy of no sex education, telling teenagers that abstinence is the only method, as well as shaming women from getting abortions. 

So such a society should have a system that ensure that these children are taken care of. Be that through supporting parents economically to ensure that the children get food, go to school, get an education, and succeed at becoming well balanced citizens. Or through a more efficient adoption and foster care system that makes it easier for people both willing to give their child up for adoption, as well as the people willing to adopt children.

That is just not the reality observed in the US, where fertility methods are shunned, and not made readily available, that is where my problem is. You either accept the consequences of your ethical reality as a society, or make the methods to control fertility readily available, so that people can decide for themselves how they want to behave.


America in a nutshell, is that the children have become a societal issue, as long as they are in the womb, but when they get out, society shuns the responsibility of them growing up into well functioning people and well balanced citizens.

"
"2217",1376,"Murgie",9,9,1372,2,0,"&gt;Where does the ethic that not existing is better than being an unwanted child come from? I'm just interested in the rationale because that one's always eluded me. 

It's exactly the same rationale behind every single sperm or egg cell that you produce and do not actively attempt to make into a child, mate. 

Like, nonexistence isn't an *alternative* state of being that can be thought of as better or worse than other possible states. Rather, it's the absence of one altogether.  "
"2218",1377,"NoahPM",9,9,1376,2,0,"But obviously at *some point* something stops being nonexistence and becomes putting an end to existence.  And obviously that doesn't remedy the awkwardness in feeling bad for an unwanted child and saying it would be better for him/her if they didn't exist.  There's merit to the argument that you would vouch for every existing unwanted child's existence when considering what you should do with a 3 pound bundle of cells in the shape of a human being sitting inside of a mother that doesn't want it.  As long as your insisting it's for the child's benefit, that argument is relevant.

It just irks me because I see people calling pro-life people hypocrites because I guess something about being pro-life means you're against adoption too or child welfare, while the pro-choice crowd tries to express the hypocritical sentiment that it's better for the child to not be brought into this world while admitting it's a good thing an unwanted child was born.  You have to suggest it's bad that the child was born in the first place for this to be logically consistent.  Again, so long as your argument for abortion is that it's for the child's benefit, which I'm aware isn't the only argument for abortion but a weird one indeed.

When artificial wombs become a thing I will gladly be against abortion while admitting I have no idea if I would be for or against it if they didn't exist.  Ethically/philosophically that is; I don't claim the right to force you to have birth because I grapple with and try to explore the ethics of such a personal decision."

Cool. Be prepared to start the process at least 1-2 years earlier than you are ready. You MIGHT get matched before then.

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Besides, with new advancements in medicine it's becoming increasingly common for people to screen for genetic disorders in a fertilized egg and implant only the eggs that don't carry the disorder, effectively eradicating that disorder in their bloodline. "

"2372",1025,"sewsewsewyourboat",10,8,322,2,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability. Additionally, in a world with unlimited resources I am perfectly fine with these people pursuing artificial options of creating a child of their own genetic line, but we dont live in that world."
"2374",1408,"sewsewsewyourboat",10,10,1026,1,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

It sucks that there are so many children that go unadopted, and I get a little upset when I see people so adamant in having biological children instead like in the article, but it can be extremely difficult to adopt and I cant blame people from not going that route."

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"2489",1261,"papadanku42",10,9,1260,12,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "

Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "

I've never experienced such deep heartbreak as I have from miscarriages and infertility problems over the past 8 years.  Just adopting or fostering doesn't fix that and can potentially come with many more challenges that a couple with their own children never have to deal with.

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA. I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar.

 Please don't mistake my curiosity for disdain. You have a right to feel the way you feel, as does anyone.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."
"2532",1420,"papadanku42",10,10,1419,1,0,"Thank you for your insight ! I've heard a lot of reasons for why someone would choose not to adopt including cost, length, difficulty, etc.

I guess at the end of the day it just comes down to the fact that some people have feelings of desire for kids, usually biological, and would do anything to achieve that. 

My question goes for any prospective parent, not just people with fertility issues. I guess I just don't understand why people want kids at all to be honest. 

I wish you the best of luck and hope that you are able to fullfill your wants somehow, be it adoption or birth or anything inbetween. "
"2533",1308,"mcraneschair",10,9,88,16,0,"You're expecting someone to give up a key part of the human experience because of other people's issues and problems. Yes, it is awful how many kids are without parents but that doesn't mean I should have to retrack my life because of them. There are kids without proper education, full meals, or clothes on their back. This doesn't mean I forfeit my learning, my food, or my clothes. It's extremely unfair to ask someone to completely revolve their life and choices around someone else's. "
"2534",1310,"___Ambarussa___",10,9,88,3,0,"Adoption isnt some romantic easy thing. You cant just mosie on down to Babys R Us and select whichever cherub you fancy. 

Not to mention that a lot of those kids come from an abusive home life or a drug addicted mother. Even smoking cigarettes increases the risk of learning disability, ADHD and lowered IQ. People who adopt are taking on an unknown and have a much bigger risk of dealing with serious problems. 

Carrying my own babies means I know their full history and have always given them the very best I can. I dont want a FAS baby.

Not to mention the experience of growing a baby inside your own body is absolutely amazing. Its very appealing in a basic biological way. "
"2535",1421,"papadanku42",10,10,1310,1,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."
"2536",1311,"MacPho13",10,9,88,3,0,"A person should only adopt or foster if they want to. Not just because they cant have biological children or would have difficulty having them. Adopting and fostering comes with its own challenges.

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why? Because the adopted or foster child has been through enough difficulty and possibly trauma in their lives. They are a child, NOT a doll. They should be, as every child should be, in a home with a parent or parents that love them and want them."

The issue is that it's a lot of work, there's psychological and dependancy issues with the crack-baby and if you don't have the money to deal with those issues, they compound.  It's just riskier than having your own kid in terms of issues that the child could have.  "

Either because it seems fun, because you want to preserve your legacy, or whatever other reasons people can come up with, it's always going to be for your own benefit, not the child's. A child doesn't benefit from being born into this world."
"2548",1426,"papadanku42",10,10,1425,7,0,"Very interesting point. No one asks to be born. They are born due to the desire of the parent alone. I guess it is a long philosophical debate to talk about wether or not oen benefits from being born. "
"2549",1427,"depression_is_fun",10,10,1426,1,0,"Oh yeah, I've had many a long talks about that topic. Definitely very interesting to think about."
"2550",1428,"depression_is_fun",10,10,1425,2,0,"There are definitely layers to the selfishness though. As the person above you said 

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

"
"2631",1470,"Saphibella",10,10,1467,2,0,"Well I understand that you struggle with it, because it is a very very difficult subject with a lot of different viewpoints.

And of course there is also a difference between using preventative methods during sex, which should definitely be the preferred method of preventing pregnancy, and abortion, which should be the no other way out method. But that does not mean that people should be shamed by using either method, or that it should be a taboo.

But we also have to accept that if a society is for life of a foetus/child no matter what, then there are some responsibilities that follow, which we just have to be clear about, because if those responsibilities are shunned, it is the children that suffer in the end, and is no existence better than a life full of suffering from start to finish?

If children which could be prevented, now have been put on Earth, they need to be taken care of, and they should ideally be the responsibility of the parents that gave them life. 

But then there is the responsibility of a society that gets to decide how people should behave through policy of no sex education, telling teenagers that abstinence is the only method, as well as shaming women from getting abortions. 

So such a society should have a system that ensure that these children are taken care of. Be that through supporting parents economically to ensure that the children get food, go to school, get an education, and succeed at becoming well balanced citizens. Or through a more efficient adoption and foster care system that makes it easier for people both willing to give their child up for adoption, as well as the people willing to adopt children.

That is just not the reality observed in the US, where fertility methods are shunned, and not made readily available, that is where my problem is. You either accept the consequences of your ethical reality as a society, or make the methods to control fertility readily available, so that people can decide for themselves how they want to behave.


America in a nutshell, is that the children have become a societal issue, as long as they are in the womb, but when they get out, society shuns the responsibility of them growing up into well functioning people and well balanced citizens.

It's exactly the same rationale behind every single sperm or egg cell that you produce and do not actively attempt to make into a child, mate. 

Like, nonexistence isn't an *alternative* state of being that can be thought of as better or worse than other possible states. Rather, it's the absence of one altogether.  "
"2633",1472,"NoahPM",10,10,1471,2,0,"But obviously at *some point* something stops being nonexistence and becomes putting an end to existence.  And obviously that doesn't remedy the awkwardness in feeling bad for an unwanted child and saying it would be better for him/her if they didn't exist.  There's merit to the argument that you would vouch for every existing unwanted child's existence when considering what you should do with a 3 pound bundle of cells in the shape of a human being sitting inside of a mother that doesn't want it.  As long as your insisting it's for the child's benefit, that argument is relevant.

It just irks me because I see people calling pro-life people hypocrites because I guess something about being pro-life means you're against adoption too or child welfare, while the pro-choice crowd tries to express the hypocritical sentiment that it's better for the child to not be brought into this world while admitting it's a good thing an unwanted child was born.  You have to suggest it's bad that the child was born in the first place for this to be logically consistent.  Again, so long as your argument for abortion is that it's for the child's benefit, which I'm aware isn't the only argument for abortion but a weird one indeed.

When artificial wombs become a thing I will gladly be against abortion while admitting I have no idea if I would be for or against it if they didn't exist.

Survival of the fittest, right? Only those who are strong enough to survive and reproduce should be able to.

If any of her genetics are responsible for that, she would pass those on to her child. 

Lets say her future daughter is born infertile. Because of her mothers good genes, according The the logic of survival of the fittest, she would be more likely to find another way to reproduce. 

And if genetics have nothing to do with this womans ability to get to a point in her life where this is an option, then her own skills must be responsible. In that case, shed be able to teach those skills to her daughter.

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Besides, with new advancements in medicine it's becoming increasingly common for people to screen for genetic disorders in a fertilized egg and implant only the eggs that don't carry the disorder, effectively eradicating that disorder in their bloodline. "

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand.

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability. Additionally, in a world with unlimited resources I am perfectly fine with these people pursuing artificial options of creating a child of their own genetic line, but we dont live in that world."
"2754",1408,"sewsewsewyourboat",11,10,1026,2,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"2867",1508,"dont--panic",11,11,1507,2,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA. I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar. I guess I am just wondering what reasons people have to want a biological child but not wanting to adopt one.

 Please don't mistake my curiosity for disdain. You have a right to feel the way you feel, as does anyone.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."
"2906",1544,"papadanku42",11,11,1543,1,0,"Thank you for your insight ! I've heard a lot of reasons for why someone would choose not to adopt including cost, length, difficulty, etc.

I guess at the end of the day it just comes down to the fact that some people have feelings of desire for kids, usually biological, and would do anything to achieve that. 

My question goes for any prospective parent, not just people with fertility issues. I guess I just don't understand why people want kids at all to be honest. 

I wish you the best of luck and hope that you are able to fullfill your wants somehow, be it adoption or birth or anything inbetween. "
"2907",1545,"___Ambarussa___",11,11,92,7,0,"Adoption isnt some romantic easy thing. You cant just mosie on down to Babys R Us and select whichever cherub you fancy. 

Not to mention that a lot of those kids come from an abusive home life or a drug addicted mother. Even smoking cigarettes increases the risk of learning disability, ADHD and lowered IQ. People who adopt are taking on an unknown and have a much bigger risk of dealing with serious problems. 

Carrying my own babies means I know their full history and have always given them the very best I can. I dont want a FAS baby.

Not to mention the experience of growing a baby inside your own body is absolutely amazing. Its very appealing in a basic biological way. "

"2912",1550,"hilly4rilly",11,11,1549,6,0,"I know a foster family that adopted a crack-baby and autistic child, which is great.  The issue is that it's a lot of work, there's psychological and dependancy issues with the crack-baby and if you don't have the money to deal with those issues, they compound.  It's just riskier than having your own kid in terms of issues that the child could have.  "

"2920",1558,"papadanku42",11,11,1557,7,0,"Very interesting point. No one asks to be born. They are born due to the desire of the parent alone. I guess it is a long philosophical debate to talk about wether or not oen benefits from being born. "

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"2923",1561,"Grenyn",11,11,1560,2,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"2924",1562,"A1000eisn1",11,11,1561,3,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

All that just to add one more person to eventually hate their job and sit in a car 2 hours a day."
"2925",1563,"depression_is_fun",11,11,1561,1,0,"You have exactly the same views I have of basically not consenting to be born. You are bringing an new life into a world knowing full well there is a 100% chance it is going to experience pain, regret, sadness, sorrow, etc. Yes they will feel happiness and all that too, bit it isn't guaranteed to be because or illness across every spectrum, any form of assault or abuse, etc etc. There is someone already giving a not so desirable life (someone in foster care) that you could help have a great life. No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing. Like, think about Lincoln's decendents, or Hitler's, or Washingtons, are they somehow humanly better than any one else in the year 2019 that they somehow wouldn't have if instead if the having kids they were adopted??? No, not at all. Ok, maybe they wouldn't kinda look like their ancestor...who gives a shit? Idk."

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

"3001",1593,"Saphibella",11,11,1462,3,0,"Well I understand that you struggle with it, because it is a very very difficult subject with a lot of different viewpoints.

And of course there is also a difference between using preventative methods during sex, which should definitely be the preferred method of preventing pregnancy, and abortion, which should be the no other way out method. But that does not mean that people should be shamed by using either method, or that it should be a taboo.

But we also have to accept that if a society is for life of a foetus/child no matter what, then there are some responsibilities that follow, which we just have to be clear about, because if those responsibilities are shunned, it is the children that suffer in the end, and is no existence better than a life full of suffering from start to finish?

If children which could be prevented, now have been put on Earth, they need to be taken care of, and they should ideally be the responsibility of the parents that gave them life. 

But then there is the responsibility of a society that gets to decide how people should behave through policy of no sex education, telling teenagers that abstinence is the only method, as well as shaming women from getting abortions. 

So such a society should have a system that ensure that these children are taken care of. Be that through supporting parents economically to ensure that the children get food, go to school, get an education, and succeed at becoming well balanced citizens. Or through a more efficient adoption and foster care system that makes it easier for people both willing to give their child up for adoption, as well as the people willing to adopt children.

That is just not the reality observed in the US, where fertility methods are shunned, and not made readily available, that is where my problem is. You either accept the consequences of your ethical reality as a society, or make the methods to control fertility readily available, so that people can decide for themselves how they want to behave.


America in a nutshell, is that the children have become a societal issue, as long as they are in the womb, but when they get out, society shuns the responsibility of them growing up into well functioning people and well balanced citizens.

It's exactly the same rationale behind every single sperm or egg cell that you produce and do not actively attempt to make into a child, mate. 

Like, nonexistence isn't an *alternative* state of being that can be thought of as better or worse than other possible states. Rather, it's the absence of one altogether.  "
"3005",1597,"NoahPM",11,11,1596,2,0,"But obviously at *some point* something stops being nonexistence and becomes putting an end to existence.  And obviously that doesn't remedy the awkwardness in feeling bad for an unwanted child and saying it would be better for him/her if they didn't exist.  There's merit to the argument that you would vouch for every existing unwanted child's existence when considering what you should do with a 3 pound bundle of cells in the shape of a human being sitting inside of a mother that doesn't want it.  As long as your insisting it's for the child's benefit, that argument is relevant.

It just irks me because I see people calling pro-life people hypocrites because I guess something about being pro-life means you're against adoption too or child welfare, while the pro-choice crowd tries to express the hypocritical sentiment that it's better for the child to not be brought into this world while admitting it's a good thing an unwanted child was born.  You have to suggest it's bad that the child was born in the first place for this to be logically consistent.  Again, so long as your argument for abortion is that it's for the child's benefit, which I'm aware isn't the only argument for abortion but a weird one indeed.

When artificial wombs become a thing I will gladly be against abortion while admitting I have no idea if I would be for or against it if they didn't exist.

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

By the time that kid is grown, if she had the disorder I can guarantee the science behind it is going to be worlds better than what we have now so yeah...no problemo.

Besides, with new advancements in medicine it's becoming increasingly common for people to screen for genetic disorders in a fertilized egg and implant only the eggs that don't carry the disorder, effectively eradicating that disorder in their bloodline. "
"3125",1025,"sewsewsewyourboat",12,8,322,2,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "
"3126",1026,"empathetichuman",12,8,1025,12,0,"There is adoption, though I believe that people usually want babies which are in high demand and difficult to adopt. For me, I cannot get past people feeling a need to have a baby, and I dont know whether the physiological burden that this need causes is worth all of the societal effort in terms of surrogates or uterine transplants, especially when there are children that have no family and just need some support and stability. I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability. Additionally, in a world with unlimited resources I am perfectly fine with these people pursuing artificial options of creating a child of their own genetic line, but we dont live in that world."
"3127",1408,"sewsewsewyourboat",12,10,1026,2,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

"3255",1631,"papadanku42",12,12,1630,17,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"3256",1632,"dont--panic",12,12,1631,2,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA. I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar. I guess I am just wondering what reasons people have to want a biological child but not wanting to adopt one.

 Please don't mistake my curiosity for disdain. You have a right to feel the way you feel, as does anyone.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."
"3295",1662,"papadanku42",12,12,1661,1,0,"Thank you for your insight ! I've heard a lot of reasons for why someone would choose not to adopt including cost, length, difficulty, etc.

I guess at the end of the day it just comes down to the fact that some people have feelings of desire for kids, usually biological, and would do anything to achieve that. 

My question goes for any prospective parent, not just people with fertility issues. I guess I just don't understand why people want kids at all to be honest. 

I wish you the best of luck and hope that you are able to fullfill your wants somehow, be it adoption or birth or anything inbetween. "

Not to mention that a lot of those kids come from an abusive home life or a drug addicted mother. Even smoking cigarettes increases the risk of learning disability, ADHD and lowered IQ. People who adopt are taking on an unknown and have a much bigger risk of dealing with serious problems. 

Carrying my own babies means I know their full history and have always given them the very best I can. I dont want a FAS baby.

Not to mention the experience of growing a baby inside your own body is absolutely amazing. Its very appealing in a basic biological way. "

The issue is that it's a lot of work, there's psychological and dependancy issues with the crack-baby and if you don't have the money to deal with those issues, they compound.  It's just riskier than having your own kid in terms of issues that the child could have.  "

"3309",1676,"papadanku42",12,12,1675,8,0,"Very interesting point. No one asks to be born. They are born due to the desire of the parent alone. I guess it is a long philosophical debate to talk about wether or not oen benefits from being born. "

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"3312",1679,"Grenyn",12,12,1678,2,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"3313",1680,"A1000eisn1",12,12,1679,4,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

All that just to add one more person to eventually hate their job and sit in a car 2 hours a day."
"3314",1681,"depression_is_fun",12,12,1679,2,0,"You have exactly the same views I have of basically not consenting to be born. You are bringing an new life into a world knowing full well there is a 100% chance it is going to experience pain, regret, sadness, sorrow, etc. Yes they will feel happiness and all that too, bit it isn't guaranteed to be because or illness across every spectrum, any form of assault or abuse, etc etc. There is someone already giving a not so desirable life (someone in foster care) that you could help have a great life. No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing. Like, think about Lincoln's decendents, or Hitler's, or Washingtons, are they somehow humanly better than any one else in the year 2019 that they somehow wouldn't have if instead if the having kids they were adopted???

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"3331",1698,"recovering_spaz",12,12,246,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

By the time that kid is grown, if she had the disorder I can guarantee the science behind it is going to be worlds better than what we have now so yeah...no problemo.

Besides, with new advancements in medicine it's becoming increasingly common for people to screen for genetic disorders in a fertilized egg and implant only the eggs that don't carry the disorder, effectively eradicating that disorder in their bloodline. "
"3493",1025,"sewsewsewyourboat",13,8,322,2,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "
"3494",1026,"empathetichuman",13,8,1025,8,0,"There is adoption, though I believe that people usually want babies which are in high demand and difficult to adopt.

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability. Additionally, in a world with unlimited resources I am perfectly fine with these people pursuing artificial options of creating a child of their own genetic line, but we dont live in that world."
"3495",1408,"sewsewsewyourboat",13,10,1026,3,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

&gt;It is possible for a mothers red blood cells to cross into the placenta or fetus during pregnancy. When this occurs, the mothers blood cells develop antibodies that can attack the newborns blood cells and cause jaundice. ... If an Rh incompatibility is found, an Rh-immune globulin treatment is administered about 28 weeks into the pregnancy. If the incompatibility is not detected, the newborn can develop severe jaundice leading to brain damage. "

This is only a risk for rhesus negative mothers carrying rhesus positive babies. If its the other way round or both are the same there is no issue.

Foster care adoptions can be fast and cheap but have a lot of red tape and a high failure rate. Not only that, but kids in foster care are much more likely to have psychological problems or developmental delays stemming from abuse or drug exposure. 

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

It makes sense to me that agencies would double check that people can afford a kid before giving them one. Same goes for the home inspection. "

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"3615",1732,"papadanku42",13,13,1731,17,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"3616",1733,"dont--panic",13,13,1732,2,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone.

I've never experienced such deep heartbreak as I have from miscarriages and infertility problems over the past 8 years.  Just adopting or fostering doesn't fix that and can potentially come with many more challenges that a couple with their own children never have to deal with.  It's just not an either/or situation for most people.  Maybe you are one of those wonderful people who have adopted and fostered children and that's why you don't understand?

I guess I am an optimistic person who sees this type of situation as an opportunity to do good and help a child in need. I can't personally understand why someone would prefer to go through such a drastic surgery, becoming immunocompromised, just to have a biological child instead of adopting one.

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA. I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar. I guess I am just wondering what reasons people have to want a biological child but not wanting to adopt one.

 Please don't mistake my curiosity for disdain. You have a right to feel the way you feel, as does anyone. 

Can anyone tell me what reasons (besides cost or wanting to pass along their DNA since these have already been discussed) there are for men or women to have a biological child but not adopt one ?

"3652",1765,"vangoghism",13,13,1763,2,0,"I read your original post as judgemental but to be fair I'm sensitive to being judged in this area.  Since you are genuinely curious I'll be glad to share.  

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."
"3653",1766,"papadanku42",13,13,1765,1,0,"Thank you for your insight ! I've heard a lot of reasons for why someone would choose not to adopt including cost, length, difficulty, etc.

I guess at the end of the day it just comes down to the fact that some people have feelings of desire for kids, usually biological, and would do anything to achieve that. 

My question goes for any prospective parent, not just people with fertility issues. I guess I just don't understand why people want kids at all to be honest. 

I wish you the best of luck and hope that you are able to fullfill your wants somehow, be it adoption or birth or anything inbetween. "

In less than a year you will have to care for another living being that will be perfectly innocent and know nothing but what you teach them. You slowly grow this tiny human, feeling it move inside you. This little baby hears your heart beat, and your voice. Excitement, worry, fear, joy, anticipation and all sorts of thoughts and emotions flow through you. 

Eventually, you get sick of peeing 6 times a night and having swollen feet. You want this baby out. You go to the hospital your body in so much pain, but the nurses are clam and efficient. Your SO quietly freaking out beside you. Your mother reassuring you. You have a team of people supporting you as your body 'rips you a new one.'

&amp;#x200B;

I've personally seen the transformation that can come of someone having a child. 

My own brother completely turned his life around after the birth of his daughter. He was an intense partier and going down a bad path after the death of our mother, he was going to give his daughter up for adoption before she was born as he knew he wasn't a fit parent but instead ended up keeping her and turning his life around for the better. Had he never had his daughter he might still be in a depressive coke spiral but, according to him, seeing his daughter triggered some unreal emotions and made him want to do it all for her."
"3661",1774,"papadanku42",13,13,1773,2,0,"Having a child isn't important to everyone. For some it could be an amazing, life-altering miracle. For some it could be a choice they don't think twice about. Some people don't have children at all. Every human's experience is different, so you can't really claim as fact that having children is a key part of the human experience. 

Also, isn't it selfish to have children to cure your depression or addiction? Sure, it worked out for your brother, but how many children are born with fetal alcohol syndrome or addicted to drugs because they had druggie parents ? How many children are neglected and abused by parents who thought a child would turn their life around ?

Expecting someone to ""cure"" you is a huge burden to put on anyone, let alone a child. IMO you should have a child because you want to give THEM a good life, not because you expect them to make YOUR life better. "
"3662",1775,"hilly4rilly",13,13,242,7,0,"I agree, but also, do you really want to roll the dice? Having a kid, I'm assuming, is a very rewarding experience and life-changing according to those who have kids (I don't, so I don't know). "

"3664",1777,"hilly4rilly",13,13,1776,6,0,"I know a foster family that adopted a crack-baby and autistic child, which is great.  The issue is that it's a lot of work, there's psychological and dependancy issues with the crack-baby and if you don't have the money to deal with those issues, they compound.  It's just riskier than having your own kid in terms of issues that the child could have.  "

Either because it seems fun, because you want to preserve your legacy, or whatever other reasons people can come up with, it's always going to be for your own benefit, not the child's. A child doesn't benefit from being born into this world."
"3672",1785,"papadanku42",13,13,1784,7,0,"Very interesting point. No one asks to be born. They are born due to the desire of the parent alone. I guess it is a long philosophical debate to talk about wether or not oen benefits from being born. "

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"3675",1788,"Grenyn",13,13,1787,3,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"3676",1789,"A1000eisn1",13,13,1788,6,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

All that just to add one more person to eventually hate their job and sit in a car 2 hours a day."

No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"3694",1807,"recovering_spaz",13,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics?

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand.

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters.

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"3985",1829,"papadanku42",14,14,1828,17,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"3986",1830,"dont--panic",14,14,1829,5,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."
"4023",1835,"papadanku42",14,14,1542,1,0,"Thank you for your insight ! I've heard a lot of reasons for why someone would choose not to adopt including cost, length, difficulty, etc.

I guess at the end of the day it just comes down to the fact that some people have feelings of desire for kids, usually biological, and would do anything to achieve that. 

My question goes for any prospective parent, not just people with fertility issues. I guess I just don't understand why people want kids at all to be honest. 

I wish you the best of luck and hope that you are able to fullfill your wants somehow, be it adoption or birth or anything inbetween. "

&amp;#x200B;

I've personally seen the transformation that can come of someone having a child. 

My own brother completely turned his life around after the birth of his daughter. He was an intense partier and going down a bad path after the death of our mother, he was going to give his daughter up for adoption before she was born as he knew he wasn't a fit parent but instead ended up keeping her and turning his life around for the better.

For some it could be a choice they don't think twice about. Some people don't have children at all. Every human's experience is different, so you can't really claim as fact that having children is a key part of the human experience. 

Also, isn't it selfish to have children to cure your depression or addiction? Sure, it worked out for your brother, but how many children are born with fetal alcohol syndrome or addicted to drugs because they had druggie parents ? How many children are neglected and abused by parents who thought a child would turn their life around ?

Expecting someone to ""cure"" you is a huge burden to put on anyone, let alone a child. IMO you should have a child because you want to give THEM a good life, not because you expect them to make YOUR life better. "

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"4065",1579,"recovering_spaz",14,11,92,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

I've read of stories about very irresponsible, unqualified surros resulting in a miscarriage or failed transfer. Not to mention the legal aspects of things. Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Every child has a risk of having a genetic defect, and at some point even an elevated risk is still acceptable over being unable to have the child at all.

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Thanks for not taking offense at my youth question- I know it could have been seen as pretty mean. Thanks for understanding my meaning.


The thing is, I can't have kids. Born that way, though I didn't know as a kid (until my teen years). I have a similar disorder to the one from the woman in the article. I personally don't want kids, so it's no big loss (though there are other health consequences). Still, I do have a biological urge to reproduce. I don't *want* to have kids, but my brain wants to get pregnant, though I can't.

Especially considering that if the woman in the article has a daughter with the same disorder there's now a valid treatment, I don't think we should be judging.


re: climate change, I know exactly how you feel. I'm fucking terrified of climate change. But at the same time I think it's pretty clear that convincing people not to reproduce so the climate won't suffer is pretty absurd- people don't think like that. There's only two ways out of climate change:

1. Total ecosystem collapse leading to the end of the world as we know it

2. Technological innovation in green technologies making them cheaper than their damaging alternatives together with govt incentives (such as tax rebates for solar panels, no sales tax on electric cars, etc).


Having fewer babies to save the climate isn't going to happen. There are only two things that have ever caused people to have fewer children consistently:

1. Natural disaster such as famine, plague, drought, ice-age...

2. Wealth. The wealthier people are the fewer children they have. As in, when people don't need to worry about food, jobs, housing etc they have fewer kids.

In the 60s/70s it was projected that world population would continue to increase exponentially leading to worldwide famines by the end of the century. In fact, the US govt started working on contingency plans to blockade places like africa and deny them all food. Crazy, I know, but back then overpopulation was seen as an imminent existential threat. But as time went on and fewer and fewer people lived in poverty the population growth rate began to slow.

So you want to protect the environment? Make it *easier* for people to be green! If you're in high school, ask the administration if you can set up a battery recycling station so kids can bring spent batteries from home. Get a 5 gallon bucket, write ""BATTERY RECYCLING- PLACE USED BATTERIES HERE!"" on it and cut a 2 inch wide hole in the lid. If it's that easy, folks will grab used batteries from home and bring them to school instead of tossing them in the trash. Now every once in a while you take the bucket (it'll be heavy!!) to the recycling center and you'll have made a real difference!"

"4245",1025,"sewsewsewyourboat",15,8,322,3,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand.

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability. Additionally, in a world with unlimited resources I am perfectly fine with these people pursuing artificial options of creating a child of their own genetic line, but we dont live in that world."
"4247",1408,"sewsewsewyourboat",15,10,1026,3,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters.

"4369",1734,"papadanku42",15,13,1731,20,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "

Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."
"4408",1768,"papadanku42",15,13,1767,1,0,"Thank you for your insight ! I've heard a lot of reasons for why someone would choose not to adopt including cost, length, difficulty, etc.

I guess at the end of the day it just comes down to the fact that some people have feelings of desire for kids, usually biological, and would do anything to achieve that. 

My question goes for any prospective parent, not just people with fertility issues. I guess I just don't understand why people want kids at all to be honest. 

I wish you the best of luck and hope that you are able to fullfill your wants somehow, be it adoption or birth or anything inbetween. "

Not to mention that a lot of those kids come from an abusive home life or a drug addicted mother. Even smoking cigarettes increases the risk of learning disability, ADHD and lowered IQ. People who adopt are taking on an unknown and have a much bigger risk of dealing with serious problems.

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"4445",1805,"recovering_spaz",15,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby.

"4611",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",16,8,323,11,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "
"4612",1879,"empathetichuman",16,16,1027,11,0,"There is adoption, though I believe that people usually want babies which are in high demand and difficult to adopt. For me, I cannot get past people feeling a need to have a baby, and I dont know whether the physiological burden that this need causes is worth all of the societal effort in terms of surrogates or uterine transplants, especially when there are children that have no family and just need some support and stability. I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability. Additionally, in a world with unlimited resources I am perfectly fine with these people pursuing artificial options of creating a child of their own genetic line, but we dont live in that world."
"4613",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",16,16,1879,5,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

By the time that kid is grown, if she had the disorder I can guarantee the science behind it is going to be worlds better than what we have now so yeah...no problemo.

Every child has a risk of having a genetic defect, and at some point even an elevated risk is still acceptable over being unable to have the child at all.

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "

"4745",1948,"papadanku42",16,16,1946,20,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "

Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA. I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar. I guess I am just wondering what reasons people have to want a biological child but not wanting to adopt one.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."
"4777",1963,"papadanku42",16,16,1962,1,0,"Thank you for your insight ! I've heard a lot of reasons for why someone would choose not to adopt including cost, length, difficulty, etc.

I guess at the end of the day it just comes down to the fact that some people have feelings of desire for kids, usually biological, and would do anything to achieve that. 

My question goes for any prospective parent, not just people with fertility issues. I guess I just don't understand why people want kids at all to be honest. 

I wish you the best of luck and hope that you are able to fullfill your wants somehow, be it adoption or birth or anything inbetween. "

"4785",1763,"papadanku42",16,13,1762,3,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."
"4786",1764,"kotoku",16,13,1763,4,0,"If you have your own baby you have the luxury of genetic counselors (and if you go the implantation route, embryonic screening).

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"4787",1964,"papadanku42",16,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"4804",1788,"Grenyn",16,13,1787,4,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"4805",1789,"A1000eisn1",16,13,1788,5,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"4822",1805,"recovering_spaz",16,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

I can understand why a woman/couple wants to give birth herself to her own baby, so since science can now make this possible with a donated womb maybe there's no reason not to. Yet the part of me that is creeped out by the thought of transplanting a womb from a deceased woman makes me wonder why the couple would not just use IVF and a surrogate for the pregnancy.

Certainly some countries do."
"4825",959,"thatonegirl127",16,7,243,3,0,"I know several surros/IPs and I can tell you that most any IP would much rather have their own child. Surrogacy is insanely expensive (though I'm betting so would this procedure), but you also have to deal with the stress of someone else carrying your baby. I've read of stories about very irresponsible, unqualified surros resulting in a miscarriage or failed transfer. Not to mention the legal aspects of things. Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

"4992",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",17,8,323,12,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

"4994",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",17,16,1879,7,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting.

&gt;It is possible for a mothers red blood cells to cross into the placenta or fetus during pregnancy. When this occurs, the mothers blood cells develop antibodies that can attack the newborns blood cells and cause jaundice. ... If an Rh incompatibility is found, an Rh-immune globulin treatment is administered about 28 weeks into the pregnancy. If the incompatibility is not detected, the newborn can develop severe jaundice leading to brain damage. "

This is only a risk for rhesus negative mothers carrying rhesus positive babies. If its the other way round or both are the same there is no issue.

Foster care adoptions can be fast and cheap but have a lot of red tape and a high failure rate. Not only that, but kids in foster care are much more likely to have psychological problems or developmental delays stemming from abuse or drug exposure. 

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

First of all, adoptions are expensive with the average cost being $25,000. Secondly, we wanted a baby, not a grown child which means the available pool of children to do adopted was even smaller and in higher demand. 

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "
"5124",1735,"papadanku42",17,13,648,15,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ? 

In response to the money aspect:

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

It makes sense to me that agencies would double check that people can afford a kid before giving them one. Same goes for the home inspection. "
"5125",1946,"_Z_E_R_O",17,16,1735,39,0,"It makes a lot of sense, yes. I never said agencies were a bad thing. I have an adopted sibling, and my family went through an agency and had a good outcome.

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"5126",1947,"Seandrunkpolarbear",17,16,1946,6,0,"Seems to me that the real problem is that it is easier to get pregnant than get drivers license! (Seriously, people in my famly have no business raising children, but here we are)  "
"5127",1948,"papadanku42",17,16,1946,20,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "

Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why? Because the adopted or foster child has been through enough difficulty and possibly trauma in their lives. They are a child, NOT a doll.

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA. I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar. I guess I am just wondering what reasons people have to want a biological child but not wanting to adopt one.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."
"5159",1963,"papadanku42",17,16,1962,1,0,"Thank you for your insight ! I've heard a lot of reasons for why someone would choose not to adopt including cost, length, difficulty, etc.

I guess at the end of the day it just comes down to the fact that some people have feelings of desire for kids, usually biological, and would do anything to achieve that. 

My question goes for any prospective parent, not just people with fertility issues. I guess I just don't understand why people want kids at all to be honest. 

I wish you the best of luck and hope that you are able to fullfill your wants somehow, be it adoption or birth or anything inbetween. "

"5167",1763,"papadanku42",17,13,1762,3,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."
"5168",1764,"kotoku",17,13,1763,4,0,"If you have your own baby you have the luxury of genetic counselors (and if you go the implantation route, embryonic screening). 

A lot of kids that need homes in an adoptive/foster situation come from some rough backgrounds. Babies born with drugs in their system, etc... are commonly the children that are removed from their parents. This damage lasts a life time. 

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"5169",1964,"papadanku42",17,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."

No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"5187",1789,"A1000eisn1",17,13,1788,6,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"5204",1805,"recovering_spaz",17,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

The baby would still be the product of their combined DNA, the only difference being who carried the baby to term. "
"5206",244,"IdlyCurious",17,4,243,13,0,"There's a lot of potential problems/issues with surrogacy, depending on where you live.  Some states are much more amenable to the process.  Some states the bio mom has no rights at all until the surrogate lets the child be adopted by mom. I think some might have compensated surrogacy illegal, but am not positive on that.  Certainly some countries do."
"5207",959,"thatonegirl127",17,7,243,3,0,"I know several surros/IPs and I can tell you that most any IP would much rather have their own child. Surrogacy is insanely expensive (though I'm betting so would this procedure), but you also have to deal with the stress of someone else carrying your baby. I've read of stories about very irresponsible, unqualified surros resulting in a miscarriage or failed transfer. Not to mention the legal aspects of things. Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand.

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

&gt;It is possible for a mothers red blood cells to cross into the placenta or fetus during pregnancy. When this occurs, the mothers blood cells develop antibodies that can attack the newborns blood cells and cause jaundice. ... If an Rh incompatibility is found, an Rh-immune globulin treatment is administered about 28 weeks into the pregnancy. If the incompatibility is not detected, the newborn can develop severe jaundice leading to brain damage. "

This is only a risk for rhesus negative mothers carrying rhesus positive babies. If its the other way round or both are the same there is no issue.

Foster care adoptions can be fast and cheap but have a lot of red tape and a high failure rate. Not only that, but kids in foster care are much more likely to have psychological problems or developmental delays stemming from abuse or drug exposure. 

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "
"5508",1735,"papadanku42",18,13,648,15,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ?

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "

"5511",1948,"papadanku42",18,16,1946,20,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "

Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone.

I've never experienced such deep heartbreak as I have from miscarriages and infertility problems over the past 8 years.  Just adopting or fostering doesn't fix that and can potentially come with many more challenges that a couple with their own children never have to deal with.

I guess I am an optimistic person who sees this type of situation as an opportunity to do good and help a child in need. I can't personally understand why someone would prefer to go through such a drastic surgery, becoming immunocompromised, just to have a biological child instead of adopting one.

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA. I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar. I guess I am just wondering what reasons people have to want a biological child but not wanting to adopt one.

 Please don't mistake my curiosity for disdain. You have a right to feel the way you feel, as does anyone.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."
"5543",1963,"papadanku42",18,16,1962,1,0,"Thank you for your insight ! I've heard a lot of reasons for why someone would choose not to adopt including cost, length, difficulty, etc.

I guess at the end of the day it just comes down to the fact that some people have feelings of desire for kids, usually biological, and would do anything to achieve that. 

My question goes for any prospective parent, not just people with fertility issues. I guess I just don't understand why people want kids at all to be honest. 

I wish you the best of luck and hope that you are able to fullfill your wants somehow, be it adoption or birth or anything inbetween. "

Carrying my own babies means I know their full history and have always given them the very best I can. I dont want a FAS baby.

Not to mention the experience of growing a baby inside your own body is absolutely amazing. Its very appealing in a basic biological way. "
"5551",1763,"papadanku42",18,13,1762,2,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."
"5552",1764,"kotoku",18,13,1763,4,0,"If you have your own baby you have the luxury of genetic counselors (and if you go the implantation route, embryonic screening). 

A lot of kids that need homes in an adoptive/foster situation come from some rough backgrounds. Babies born with drugs in their system, etc... are commonly the children that are removed from their parents. This damage lasts a life time. 

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"5553",1964,"papadanku42",18,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

It's just riskier than having your own kid in terms of issues that the child could have.  "
"5558",1965,"papadanku42",18,16,1870,14,0,"I think the risk in any situation varies greatly and depends on each individiual situation.

"5567",1785,"papadanku42",18,13,1784,9,0,"Very interesting point. No one asks to be born. They are born due to the desire of the parent alone. I guess it is a long philosophical debate to talk about wether or not oen benefits from being born. "

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"5570",1788,"Grenyn",18,13,1787,3,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"5571",1789,"A1000eisn1",18,13,1788,4,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

All that just to add one more person to eventually hate their job and sit in a car 2 hours a day."

No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"5587",1805,"recovering_spaz",18,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

Yet the part of me that is creeped out by the thought of transplanting a womb from a deceased woman makes me wonder why the couple would not just use IVF and a surrogate for the pregnancy.

Certainly some countries do."

I've read of stories about very irresponsible, unqualified surros resulting in a miscarriage or failed transfer. Not to mention the legal aspects of things. Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

We're all part of a genetic lineage stemming back to the first cell. Evolution has primed us for one purpose: to reproduce. It's the reason for being here.


I think having children is a form of denying your mortality. In some form, you'll live on, even if it's just DNA. I'm kinda really weird about this topic, tbh.

"5760",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",19,8,323,13,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand.

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

"5762",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",19,16,1879,7,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

When this occurs, the mothers blood cells develop antibodies that can attack the newborns blood cells and cause jaundice. ...

This is only a risk for rhesus negative mothers carrying rhesus positive babies. If its the other way round or both are the same there is no issue.

Foster care adoptions can be fast and cheap but have a lot of red tape and a high failure rate. Not only that, but kids in foster care are much more likely to have psychological problems or developmental delays stemming from abuse or drug exposure. 

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "
"5894",1735,"papadanku42",19,13,648,14,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ?

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "

"5897",1948,"papadanku42",19,16,1946,20,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "

Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone.

You slowly grow this tiny human, feeling it move inside you. This little baby hears your heart beat, and your voice. Excitement, worry, fear, joy, anticipation and all sorts of thoughts and emotions flow through you. 

Eventually, you get sick of peeing 6 times a night and having swollen feet. You want this baby out. You go to the hospital your body in so much pain, but the nurses are clam and efficient. Your SO quietly freaking out beside you. Your mother reassuring you. You have a team of people supporting you as your body 'rips you a new one.' Child birth sucks, but when you hold that naked baby, still wet from birth. A door just opens inside you gushing love. 

Congratulations! Now you only get to sleep 2 hours at a time and struggle to breast feed."

"5928",1962,"vangoghism",19,16,1958,2,0,"I read your original post as judgemental but to be fair I'm sensitive to being judged in this area.  Since you are genuinely curious I'll be glad to share.  

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."
"5929",1963,"papadanku42",19,16,1962,1,0,"Thank you for your insight ! I've heard a lot of reasons for why someone would choose not to adopt including cost, length, difficulty, etc.

I guess at the end of the day it just comes down to the fact that some people have feelings of desire for kids, usually biological, and would do anything to achieve that. 

My question goes for any prospective parent, not just people with fertility issues. I guess I just don't understand why people want kids at all to be honest. 

I wish you the best of luck and hope that you are able to fullfill your wants somehow, be it adoption or birth or anything inbetween. "

Not to mention that a lot of those kids come from an abusive home life or a drug addicted mother. Even smoking cigarettes increases the risk of learning disability, ADHD and lowered IQ. People who adopt are taking on an unknown and have a much bigger risk of dealing with serious problems. 

Carrying my own babies means I know their full history and have always given them the very best I can. I dont want a FAS baby.

Not to mention the experience of growing a baby inside your own body is absolutely amazing. Its very appealing in a basic biological way. "
"5937",1763,"papadanku42",19,13,1762,4,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."
"5938",1764,"kotoku",19,13,1763,4,0,"If you have your own baby you have the luxury of genetic counselors (and if you go the implantation route, embryonic screening). 

A lot of kids that need homes in an adoptive/foster situation come from some rough backgrounds. Babies born with drugs in their system, etc... are commonly the children that are removed from their parents. This damage lasts a life time. 

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"5939",1964,"papadanku42",19,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

The issue is that it's a lot of work, there's psychological and dependancy issues with the crack-baby and if you don't have the money to deal with those issues, they compound.  It's just riskier than having your own kid in terms of issues that the child could have.  "
"5944",1965,"papadanku42",19,16,1870,13,0,"I think the risk in any situation varies greatly and depends on each individiual situation.

Either because it seems fun, because you want to preserve your legacy, or whatever other reasons people can come up with, it's always going to be for your own benefit, not the child's. A child doesn't benefit from being born into this world."
"5953",1785,"papadanku42",19,13,1784,9,0,"Very interesting point. No one asks to be born. They are born due to the desire of the parent alone. I guess it is a long philosophical debate to talk about wether or not oen benefits from being born. "

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"5956",1788,"Grenyn",19,13,1787,4,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"5957",1789,"A1000eisn1",19,13,1788,4,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

All that just to add one more person to eventually hate their job and sit in a car 2 hours a day."
"5958",1790,"depression_is_fun",19,13,1788,3,0,"You have exactly the same views I have of basically not consenting to be born. You are bringing an new life into a world knowing full well there is a 100% chance it is going to experience pain, regret, sadness, sorrow, etc. Yes they will feel happiness and all that too, bit it isn't guaranteed to be because or illness across every spectrum, any form of assault or abuse, etc etc. There is someone already giving a not so desirable life (someone in foster care) that you could help have a great life. No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing. Like, think about Lincoln's decendents, or Hitler's, or Washingtons, are they somehow humanly better than any one else in the year 2019 that they somehow wouldn't have if instead if the having kids they were adopted???

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"5973",1805,"recovering_spaz",19,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

I can understand why a woman/couple wants to give birth herself to her own baby, so since science can now make this possible with a donated womb maybe there's no reason not to. Yet the part of me that is creeped out by the thought of transplanting a womb from a deceased woman makes me wonder why the couple would not just use IVF and a surrogate for the pregnancy.

Certainly some countries do."

Surrogacy is insanely expensive (though I'm betting so would this procedure), but you also have to deal with the stress of someone else carrying your baby. I've read of stories about very irresponsible, unqualified surros resulting in a miscarriage or failed transfer. Not to mention the legal aspects of things. Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

"6146",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",20,8,323,12,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "
"6147",1879,"empathetichuman",20,16,1027,14,0,"There is adoption, though I believe that people usually want babies which are in high demand and difficult to adopt. For me, I cannot get past people feeling a need to have a baby, and I dont know whether the physiological burden that this need causes is worth all of the societal effort in terms of surrogates or uterine transplants, especially when there are children that have no family and just need some support and stability. I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

"6148",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",20,16,1879,5,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

&gt;It is possible for a mothers red blood cells to cross into the placenta or fetus during pregnancy. When this occurs, the mothers blood cells develop antibodies that can attack the newborns blood cells and cause jaundice. ... If an Rh incompatibility is found, an Rh-immune globulin treatment is administered about 28 weeks into the pregnancy. If the incompatibility is not detected, the newborn can develop severe jaundice leading to brain damage. "
"6247",1260,"mrsniperrifle",20,9,91,24,0,"Rhesus disease is not due to a ""DNA mismatch"". It's due to the Rh factor.

If ""DNA Mismatch"" were a thing, all babies would be at risk and surrogates would not be possible. Everyone's DNA is ""mismatched"" because everyone's DNA is unique. "

Rhesus sensitivity occurs if the *babys* red cells get into the mothers blood stream, and thats not normally during pregnancy but can happen during birth or miscarriage. Her immune system may then start to produce antibodies. Its her antibodies that can cross the placenta during a subsequent pregnancy. 

This is only a risk for rhesus negative mothers carrying rhesus positive babies. If its the other way round or both are the same there is no issue. We dont normally know what the babys blood group is so all rhesus negative mothers should receive anti D at 28 weeks. If the baby is rhesus positive they get another dose after the birth. "

Foster care adoptions can be fast and cheap but have a lot of red tape and a high failure rate. Not only that, but kids in foster care are much more likely to have psychological problems or developmental delays stemming from abuse or drug exposure. 

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "
"6280",1735,"papadanku42",20,13,648,16,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ? 

In response to the money aspect:

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "

"6283",1948,"papadanku42",20,16,1946,21,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "

Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."
"6315",1963,"papadanku42",20,16,1962,1,0,"Thank you for your insight ! I've heard a lot of reasons for why someone would choose not to adopt including cost, length, difficulty, etc.

I guess at the end of the day it just comes down to the fact that some people have feelings of desire for kids, usually biological, and would do anything to achieve that. 

My question goes for any prospective parent, not just people with fertility issues. I guess I just don't understand why people want kids at all to be honest. 

I wish you the best of luck and hope that you are able to fullfill your wants somehow, be it adoption or birth or anything inbetween. "

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"6325",1964,"papadanku42",20,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"6359",1805,"recovering_spaz",20,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

Certainly some countries do."

I've read of stories about very irresponsible, unqualified surros resulting in a miscarriage or failed transfer. Not to mention the legal aspects of things. Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability. Additionally, in a world with unlimited resources I am perfectly fine with these people pursuing artificial options of creating a child of their own genetic line, but we dont live in that world."
"6534",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",21,16,1879,6,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome.

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

It slightly is though.

&gt;It is possible for a mothers red blood cells to cross into the placenta or fetus during pregnancy. When this occurs, the mothers blood cells develop antibodies that can attack the newborns blood cells and cause jaundice. ... If an Rh incompatibility is found, an Rh-immune globulin treatment is administered about 28 weeks into the pregnancy. If the incompatibility is not detected, the newborn can develop severe jaundice leading to brain damage. "
"6635",1260,"mrsniperrifle",21,9,91,24,0,"Rhesus disease is not due to a ""DNA mismatch"". It's due to the Rh factor.

If ""DNA Mismatch"" were a thing, all babies would be at risk and surrogates would not be possible. Everyone's DNA is ""mismatched"" because everyone's DNA is unique. "

Rhesus sensitivity occurs if the *babys* red cells get into the mothers blood stream, and thats not normally during pregnancy but can happen during birth or miscarriage. Her immune system may then start to produce antibodies. Its her antibodies that can cross the placenta during a subsequent pregnancy. 

This is only a risk for rhesus negative mothers carrying rhesus positive babies. If its the other way round or both are the same there is no issue. We dont normally know what the babys blood group is so all rhesus negative mothers should receive anti D at 28 weeks. If the baby is rhesus positive they get another dose after the birth. "

Foster care adoptions can be fast and cheap but have a lot of red tape and a high failure rate. Not only that, but kids in foster care are much more likely to have psychological problems or developmental delays stemming from abuse or drug exposure. 

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "
"6668",1735,"papadanku42",21,13,648,15,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ? 

In response to the money aspect:

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

It makes sense to me that agencies would double check that people can afford a kid before giving them one. Same goes for the home inspection. "

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"6670",1947,"Seandrunkpolarbear",21,16,1946,8,0,"Seems to me that the real problem is that it is easier to get pregnant than get drivers license! (Seriously, people in my famly have no business raising children, but here we are)  "
"6671",1948,"papadanku42",21,16,1946,19,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"6672",1949,"dont--panic",21,16,1948,3,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "
"6673",652,"MacPho13",21,6,242,13,0,"A person should only adopt or foster if they want to. Not just because they cant have biological children or would have difficulty having them. Adopting and fostering comes with its own challenges.

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc.

That's the part that separates the selfishness.

Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them.

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt.

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"6746",1805,"recovering_spaz",21,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby.

"6919",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",22,8,323,12,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

"6921",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",22,16,1879,5,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting.

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail. And thats just for domestic adoptions. If you adopt internationally youd better have $20,000+ saved up in your bank account and be prepared to deal with a foreign court system. "

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "
"7054",1735,"papadanku42",22,13,648,16,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ? 

In response to the money aspect:

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

It makes sense to me that agencies would double check that people can afford a kid before giving them one. Same goes for the home inspection. "

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "

"7057",1948,"papadanku42",22,16,1946,20,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"7058",1949,"dont--panic",22,16,1948,5,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "
"7059",652,"MacPho13",22,6,242,13,0,"A person should only adopt or foster if they want to. Not just because they cant have biological children or would have difficulty having them. Adopting and fostering comes with its own challenges.

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc.

She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"7132",1805,"recovering_spaz",22,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body.

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand.

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

"7310",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",23,16,1879,7,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting.

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters.

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "
"7443",1735,"papadanku42",23,13,648,17,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ? 

In response to the money aspect:

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

It makes sense to me that agencies would double check that people can afford a kid before giving them one. Same goes for the home inspection. "

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "

"7446",1948,"papadanku42",23,16,1946,18,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"7447",1949,"dont--panic",23,16,1948,4,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "
"7448",652,"MacPho13",23,6,242,11,0,"A person should only adopt or foster if they want to. Not just because they cant have biological children or would have difficulty having them. Adopting and fostering comes with its own challenges.

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

"7485",1763,"papadanku42",23,13,1762,3,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"7487",1964,"papadanku42",23,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

Fuck those people.

From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt.

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"7521",1805,"recovering_spaz",23,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body.

"7697",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",24,8,323,12,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "

For me, I cannot get past people feeling a need to have a baby, and I dont know whether the physiological burden that this need causes is worth all of the societal effort in terms of surrogates or uterine transplants, especially when there are children that have no family and just need some support and stability. I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

"7699",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",24,16,1879,7,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting.

First of all, adoptions are expensive with the average cost being $25,000. Secondly, we wanted a baby, not a grown child which means the available pool of children to do adopted was even smaller and in higher demand. 

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "
"7832",1735,"papadanku42",24,13,648,13,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ?

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "

"7835",1948,"papadanku42",24,16,1946,19,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"7836",1949,"dont--panic",24,16,1948,4,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "
"7837",652,"MacPho13",24,6,242,12,0,"A person should only adopt or foster if they want to. Not just because they cant have biological children or would have difficulty having them. Adopting and fostering comes with its own challenges.

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

"7874",1763,"papadanku42",24,13,1762,5,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"7876",1964,"papadanku42",24,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc.

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."

No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"7910",1805,"recovering_spaz",24,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

I've read of stories about very irresponsible, unqualified surros resulting in a miscarriage or failed transfer. Not to mention the legal aspects of things. Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

Pelvic structure is irrelevant, because a c-section would always be required with a transplanted uterus. C-sections were invented in the first place mainly for preganant women whose pelivic shape could threaten both her and her child's life during birth.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body.

"8085",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",25,8,323,11,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

"8087",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",25,16,1879,5,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters.

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "
"8220",1735,"papadanku42",25,13,648,14,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ?

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "

"8223",1948,"papadanku42",25,16,1946,18,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"8224",1949,"dont--panic",25,16,1948,4,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

"8262",1763,"papadanku42",25,13,1762,4,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"8264",1964,"papadanku42",25,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc.

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"8298",1805,"recovering_spaz",25,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body.

"8473",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",26,8,323,11,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "

For me, I cannot get past people feeling a need to have a baby, and I dont know whether the physiological burden that this need causes is worth all of the societal effort in terms of surrogates or uterine transplants, especially when there are children that have no family and just need some support and stability. I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

"8475",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",26,16,1879,6,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters.

First of all, adoptions are expensive with the average cost being $25,000. Secondly, we wanted a baby, not a grown child which means the available pool of children to do adopted was even smaller and in higher demand. 

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "
"8608",1735,"papadanku42",26,13,648,13,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ?

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

It makes sense to me that agencies would double check that people can afford a kid before giving them one. Same goes for the home inspection. "

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "

"8611",1948,"papadanku42",26,16,1946,19,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"8612",1949,"dont--panic",26,16,1948,5,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

Carrying my own babies means I know their full history and have always given them the very best I can. I dont want a FAS baby.

Not to mention the experience of growing a baby inside your own body is absolutely amazing. Its very appealing in a basic biological way. "
"8650",1763,"papadanku42",26,13,1762,4,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."

A lot of kids that need homes in an adoptive/foster situation come from some rough backgrounds. Babies born with drugs in their system, etc... are commonly the children that are removed from their parents. This damage lasts a life time. 

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"8652",1964,"papadanku42",26,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"8669",1788,"Grenyn",26,13,1787,3,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"8686",1805,"recovering_spaz",26,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

Pelvic structure is irrelevant, because a c-section would always be required with a transplanted uterus. C-sections were invented in the first place mainly for preganant women whose pelivic shape could threaten both her and her child's life during birth.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body.

"8861",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",27,8,323,12,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "
"8862",1879,"empathetichuman",27,16,1027,12,0,"There is adoption, though I believe that people usually want babies which are in high demand and difficult to adopt. For me, I cannot get past people feeling a need to have a baby, and I dont know whether the physiological burden that this need causes is worth all of the societal effort in terms of surrogates or uterine transplants, especially when there are children that have no family and just need some support and stability. I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability. Additionally, in a world with unlimited resources I am perfectly fine with these people pursuing artificial options of creating a child of their own genetic line, but we dont live in that world."
"8863",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",27,16,1879,6,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Every child has a risk of having a genetic defect, and at some point even an elevated risk is still acceptable over being unable to have the child at all.

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting.

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters.

First of all, adoptions are expensive with the average cost being $25,000. Secondly, we wanted a baby, not a grown child which means the available pool of children to do adopted was even smaller and in higher demand. 

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "
"8997",1735,"papadanku42",27,13,648,16,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ?

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

It makes sense to me that agencies would double check that people can afford a kid before giving them one. Same goes for the home inspection. "

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"8999",1947,"Seandrunkpolarbear",27,16,1946,8,0,"Seems to me that the real problem is that it is easier to get pregnant than get drivers license! (Seriously, people in my famly have no business raising children, but here we are)  "
"9000",1948,"papadanku42",27,16,1946,18,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"9001",1949,"dont--panic",27,16,1948,4,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA. I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

"9039",1763,"papadanku42",27,13,1762,3,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"9041",1964,"papadanku42",27,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc.

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"9058",1788,"Grenyn",27,13,1787,3,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"9059",1789,"A1000eisn1",27,13,1788,5,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"9075",1805,"recovering_spaz",27,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

I've read of stories about very irresponsible, unqualified surros resulting in a miscarriage or failed transfer. Not to mention the legal aspects of things. Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

Pelvic structure is irrelevant, because a c-section would always be required with a transplanted uterus. C-sections were invented in the first place mainly for preganant women whose pelivic shape could threaten both her and her child's life during birth.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body.

"9249",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",28,8,323,12,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "
"9250",1879,"empathetichuman",28,16,1027,15,0,"There is adoption, though I believe that people usually want babies which are in high demand and difficult to adopt. For me, I cannot get past people feeling a need to have a baby, and I dont know whether the physiological burden that this need causes is worth all of the societal effort in terms of surrogates or uterine transplants, especially when there are children that have no family and just need some support and stability. I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability. Additionally, in a world with unlimited resources I am perfectly fine with these people pursuing artificial options of creating a child of their own genetic line, but we dont live in that world."
"9251",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",28,16,1879,7,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Every child has a risk of having a genetic defect, and at some point even an elevated risk is still acceptable over being unable to have the child at all.

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"9387",1947,"Seandrunkpolarbear",28,16,1946,7,0,"Seems to me that the real problem is that it is easier to get pregnant than get drivers license! (Seriously, people in my famly have no business raising children, but here we are)  "
"9388",1948,"papadanku42",28,16,1946,19,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"9389",1949,"dont--panic",28,16,1948,6,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why? Because the adopted or foster child has been through enough difficulty and possibly trauma in their lives. They are a child, NOT a doll.

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA. I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar.

 Please don't mistake my curiosity for disdain. You have a right to feel the way you feel, as does anyone.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

Not to mention that a lot of those kids come from an abusive home life or a drug addicted mother. Even smoking cigarettes increases the risk of learning disability, ADHD and lowered IQ. People who adopt are taking on an unknown and have a much bigger risk of dealing with serious problems. 

Carrying my own babies means I know their full history and have always given them the very best I can. I dont want a FAS baby.

Not to mention the experience of growing a baby inside your own body is absolutely amazing. Its very appealing in a basic biological way. "
"9427",1763,"papadanku42",28,13,1762,3,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."

A lot of kids that need homes in an adoptive/foster situation come from some rough backgrounds. Babies born with drugs in their system, etc... are commonly the children that are removed from their parents. This damage lasts a life time. 

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"9429",1964,"papadanku42",28,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"9446",1788,"Grenyn",28,13,1787,3,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"9447",1789,"A1000eisn1",28,13,1788,5,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

All that just to add one more person to eventually hate their job and sit in a car 2 hours a day."
"9448",1790,"depression_is_fun",28,13,1788,3,0,"You have exactly the same views I have of basically not consenting to be born.

No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing. Like, think about Lincoln's decendents, or Hitler's, or Washingtons, are they somehow humanly better than any one else in the year 2019 that they somehow wouldn't have if instead if the having kids they were adopted???

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"9463",1805,"recovering_spaz",28,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

Certainly some countries do."

I've read of stories about very irresponsible, unqualified surros resulting in a miscarriage or failed transfer. Not to mention the legal aspects of things. Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

Pelvic structure is irrelevant, because a c-section would always be required with a transplanted uterus. C-sections were invented in the first place mainly for preganant women whose pelivic shape could threaten both her and her child's life during birth.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body.

"9636",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",29,8,323,11,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "
"9637",1879,"empathetichuman",29,16,1027,13,0,"There is adoption, though I believe that people usually want babies which are in high demand and difficult to adopt. For me, I cannot get past people feeling a need to have a baby, and I dont know whether the physiological burden that this need causes is worth all of the societal effort in terms of surrogates or uterine transplants, especially when there are children that have no family and just need some support and stability. I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

"9638",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",29,16,1879,6,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Every child has a risk of having a genetic defect, and at some point even an elevated risk is still acceptable over being unable to have the child at all.

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

"9772",1735,"papadanku42",29,13,648,14,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ?

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"9774",1947,"papadanku42",29,16,1946,19,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"9775",2041,"dont--panic",29,29,1947,4,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

"9815",1763,"papadanku42",29,13,1762,3,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"9817",1964,"papadanku42",29,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc.

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"9834",1788,"Grenyn",29,13,1787,4,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"9835",1789,"A1000eisn1",29,13,1788,6,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"9851",1805,"recovering_spaz",29,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby.

Pelvic structure is irrelevant, because a c-section would always be required with a transplanted uterus. C-sections were invented in the first place mainly for preganant women whose pelivic shape could threaten both her and her child's life during birth.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body.

"10026",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",30,8,323,12,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "
"10027",1879,"empathetichuman",30,16,1027,12,0,"There is adoption, though I believe that people usually want babies which are in high demand and difficult to adopt. For me, I cannot get past people feeling a need to have a baby, and I dont know whether the physiological burden that this need causes is worth all of the societal effort in terms of surrogates or uterine transplants, especially when there are children that have no family and just need some support and stability. I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability. Additionally, in a world with unlimited resources I am perfectly fine with these people pursuing artificial options of creating a child of their own genetic line, but we dont live in that world."
"10028",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",30,16,1879,6,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Besides, with new advancements in medicine it's becoming increasingly common for people to screen for genetic disorders in a fertilized egg and implant only the eggs that don't carry the disorder, effectively eradicating that disorder in their bloodline. "

Every child has a risk of having a genetic defect, and at some point even an elevated risk is still acceptable over being unable to have the child at all.

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

"10077",1918,"Murgie",30,16,1917,6,0,"A c-section is already the only option when using a transplanted womb, so it's really not much of a concern. 

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article. It doesn't apply to this situation, because here we know that the change came about as a result of the drastic change in environmental conditions the cells are being exposed to, and that said conditions are obviously non-carcinogenic in nature."

It also depends whether the baby was exposed to the immunosuppressants in utero or not (if they cross the placenta or not) - so whether they acted directly on the fetus or incidentally via the mom.

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "
"10162",1735,"papadanku42",30,13,648,14,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ? 

In response to the money aspect:

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

It makes sense to me that agencies would double check that people can afford a kid before giving them one. Same goes for the home inspection. "
"10163",1946,"_Z_E_R_O",30,16,1735,38,0,"It makes a lot of sense, yes. I never said agencies were a bad thing. I have an adopted sibling, and my family went through an agency and had a good outcome.

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"10164",1947,"papadanku42",30,16,1946,22,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"10165",2041,"dont--panic",30,29,1947,5,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why? Because the adopted or foster child has been through enough difficulty and possibly trauma in their lives. They are a child, NOT a doll.

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA. I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar. I guess I am just wondering what reasons people have to want a biological child but not wanting to adopt one.

 Please don't mistake my curiosity for disdain. You have a right to feel the way you feel, as does anyone.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

Not to mention that a lot of those kids come from an abusive home life or a drug addicted mother. Even smoking cigarettes increases the risk of learning disability, ADHD and lowered IQ. People who adopt are taking on an unknown and have a much bigger risk of dealing with serious problems. 

Carrying my own babies means I know their full history and have always given them the very best I can. I dont want a FAS baby.

Not to mention the experience of growing a baby inside your own body is absolutely amazing. Its very appealing in a basic biological way. "
"10205",1763,"papadanku42",30,13,1762,4,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."
"10206",1764,"kotoku",30,13,1763,5,0,"If you have your own baby you have the luxury of genetic counselors (and if you go the implantation route, embryonic screening). 

A lot of kids that need homes in an adoptive/foster situation come from some rough backgrounds. Babies born with drugs in their system, etc... are commonly the children that are removed from their parents. This damage lasts a life time. 

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"10207",1964,"papadanku42",30,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

The issue is that it's a lot of work, there's psychological and dependancy issues with the crack-baby and if you don't have the money to deal with those issues, they compound.  It's just riskier than having your own kid in terms of issues that the child could have.  "
"10212",1965,"papadanku42",30,16,1870,14,0,"I think the risk in any situation varies greatly and depends on each individiual situation.

Either because it seems fun, because you want to preserve your legacy, or whatever other reasons people can come up with, it's always going to be for your own benefit, not the child's. A child doesn't benefit from being born into this world."
"10221",1785,"papadanku42",30,13,1784,9,0,"Very interesting point. No one asks to be born. They are born due to the desire of the parent alone. I guess it is a long philosophical debate to talk about wether or not oen benefits from being born. "

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"10224",1788,"Grenyn",30,13,1787,4,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"10225",1789,"A1000eisn1",30,13,1788,5,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

All that just to add one more person to eventually hate their job and sit in a car 2 hours a day."
"10226",1790,"depression_is_fun",30,13,1788,3,0,"You have exactly the same views I have of basically not consenting to be born. You are bringing an new life into a world knowing full well there is a 100% chance it is going to experience pain, regret, sadness, sorrow, etc. Yes they will feel happiness and all that too, bit it isn't guaranteed to be because or illness across every spectrum, any form of assault or abuse, etc etc. There is someone already giving a not so desirable life (someone in foster care) that you could help have a great life. No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing. Like, think about Lincoln's decendents, or Hitler's, or Washingtons, are they somehow humanly better than any one else in the year 2019 that they somehow wouldn't have if instead if the having kids they were adopted???

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"10241",1805,"recovering_spaz",30,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

"10243",244,"IdlyCurious",30,4,243,14,0,"There's a lot of potential problems/issues with surrogacy, depending on where you live.  Some states are much more amenable to the process.

Certainly some countries do."
"10244",959,"thatonegirl127",30,7,243,4,0,"I know several surros/IPs and I can tell you that most any IP would much rather have their own child. Surrogacy is insanely expensive (though I'm betting so would this procedure), but you also have to deal with the stress of someone else carrying your baby. I've read of stories about very irresponsible, unqualified surros resulting in a miscarriage or failed transfer. Not to mention the legal aspects of things. Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

"10251",1608,"gracie_jay",30,12,248,7,0,"Essentially any single hormone or molecule produced in the human body can be synthesized into a bioidentical supplement.

Pelvic structure is irrelevant, because a c-section would always be required with a transplanted uterus. C-sections were invented in the first place mainly for preganant women whose pelivic shape could threaten both her and her child's life during birth.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body. This is why organ transplantation is so relatively straightforward. It's simply a matter of a blood type match and anti-rejection medication for the vast majority of organ transplantations, as it would be for a uterine transplant."

"10415",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",31,8,323,12,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "
"10416",1879,"empathetichuman",31,16,1027,14,0,"There is adoption, though I believe that people usually want babies which are in high demand and difficult to adopt. For me, I cannot get past people feeling a need to have a baby, and I dont know whether the physiological burden that this need causes is worth all of the societal effort in terms of surrogates or uterine transplants, especially when there are children that have no family and just need some support and stability. I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability. Additionally, in a world with unlimited resources I am perfectly fine with these people pursuing artificial options of creating a child of their own genetic line, but we dont live in that world."
"10417",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",31,16,1879,6,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

By the time that kid is grown, if she had the disorder I can guarantee the science behind it is going to be worlds better than what we have now so yeah...no problemo.

Besides, with new advancements in medicine it's becoming increasingly common for people to screen for genetic disorders in a fertilized egg and implant only the eggs that don't carry the disorder, effectively eradicating that disorder in their bloodline. "

"10426",1888,"skyman724",31,16,1883,1,0,"The risks to the child are certainly significant, but as others have said, there are ways to control for that with genetic screening. Every child has a risk of having a genetic defect, and at some point even an elevated risk is still acceptable over being unable to have the child at all.

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article. It doesn't apply to this situation, because here we know that the change came about as a result of the drastic change in environmental conditions the cells are being exposed to, and that said conditions are obviously non-carcinogenic in nature."

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

"10551",1735,"papadanku42",31,13,648,18,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ?

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"10553",1947,"papadanku42",31,16,1946,22,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"10554",2041,"dont--panic",31,29,1947,6,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "
"10555",1948,"Seandrunkpolarbear",31,16,1946,7,0,"Seems to me that the real problem is that it is easier to get pregnant than get drivers license! (Seriously, people in my famly have no business raising children, but here we are)  "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why? Because the adopted or foster child has been through enough difficulty and possibly trauma in their lives. They are a child, NOT a doll. They should be, as every child should be, in a home with a parent or parents that love them and want them."

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA. I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar. I guess I am just wondering what reasons people have to want a biological child but not wanting to adopt one.

 Please don't mistake my curiosity for disdain. You have a right to feel the way you feel, as does anyone.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

Not to mention that a lot of those kids come from an abusive home life or a drug addicted mother. Even smoking cigarettes increases the risk of learning disability, ADHD and lowered IQ. People who adopt are taking on an unknown and have a much bigger risk of dealing with serious problems. 

Carrying my own babies means I know their full history and have always given them the very best I can. I dont want a FAS baby.

Not to mention the experience of growing a baby inside your own body is absolutely amazing. Its very appealing in a basic biological way. "
"10594",1763,"papadanku42",31,13,1762,5,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."
"10595",1764,"kotoku",31,13,1763,4,0,"If you have your own baby you have the luxury of genetic counselors (and if you go the implantation route, embryonic screening). 

A lot of kids that need homes in an adoptive/foster situation come from some rough backgrounds. Babies born with drugs in their system, etc... are commonly the children that are removed from their parents. This damage lasts a life time. 

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"10596",1964,"papadanku42",31,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

"10610",1785,"papadanku42",31,13,1784,12,0,"Very interesting point. No one asks to be born. They are born due to the desire of the parent alone. I guess it is a long philosophical debate to talk about wether or not oen benefits from being born. "

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"10613",1788,"Grenyn",31,13,1787,3,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"10614",1789,"A1000eisn1",31,13,1788,5,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

All that just to add one more person to eventually hate their job and sit in a car 2 hours a day."
"10615",1790,"depression_is_fun",31,13,1788,3,0,"You have exactly the same views I have of basically not consenting to be born. You are bringing an new life into a world knowing full well there is a 100% chance it is going to experience pain, regret, sadness, sorrow, etc. Yes they will feel happiness and all that too, bit it isn't guaranteed to be because or illness across every spectrum, any form of assault or abuse, etc etc. There is someone already giving a not so desirable life (someone in foster care) that you could help have a great life. No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing. Like, think about Lincoln's decendents, or Hitler's, or Washingtons, are they somehow humanly better than any one else in the year 2019 that they somehow wouldn't have if instead if the having kids they were adopted???

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"10630",1805,"recovering_spaz",31,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

Certainly some countries do."
"10633",959,"thatonegirl127",31,7,243,5,0,"I know several surros/IPs and I can tell you that most any IP would much rather have their own child.

Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

Pelvic structure is irrelevant, because a c-section would always be required with a transplanted uterus. C-sections were invented in the first place mainly for preganant women whose pelivic shape could threaten both her and her child's life during birth.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body.

"10804",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",32,8,323,13,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "
"10805",1879,"empathetichuman",32,16,1027,12,0,"There is adoption, though I believe that people usually want babies which are in high demand and difficult to adopt. For me, I cannot get past people feeling a need to have a baby, and I dont know whether the physiological burden that this need causes is worth all of the societal effort in terms of surrogates or uterine transplants, especially when there are children that have no family and just need some support and stability. I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability. Additionally, in a world with unlimited resources I am perfectly fine with these people pursuing artificial options of creating a child of their own genetic line, but we dont live in that world."
"10806",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",32,16,1879,5,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Every child has a risk of having a genetic defect, and at some point even an elevated risk is still acceptable over being unable to have the child at all.

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article. It doesn't apply to this situation, because here we know that the change came about as a result of the drastic change in environmental conditions the cells are being exposed to, and that said conditions are obviously non-carcinogenic in nature."

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"10942",1947,"papadanku42",32,16,1946,21,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "

Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why? Because the adopted or foster child has been through enough difficulty and possibly trauma in their lives. They are a child, NOT a doll. They should be, as every child should be, in a home with a parent or parents that love them and want them."

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA. I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar. I guess I am just wondering what reasons people have to want a biological child but not wanting to adopt one.

 Please don't mistake my curiosity for disdain. You have a right to feel the way you feel, as does anyone.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

Not to mention that a lot of those kids come from an abusive home life or a drug addicted mother. Even smoking cigarettes increases the risk of learning disability, ADHD and lowered IQ. People who adopt are taking on an unknown and have a much bigger risk of dealing with serious problems. 

Carrying my own babies means I know their full history and have always given them the very best I can. I dont want a FAS baby.

Not to mention the experience of growing a baby inside your own body is absolutely amazing. Its very appealing in a basic biological way. "
"10983",1763,"papadanku42",32,13,1762,4,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."
"10984",1764,"kotoku",32,13,1763,3,0,"If you have your own baby you have the luxury of genetic counselors (and if you go the implantation route, embryonic screening). 

A lot of kids that need homes in an adoptive/foster situation come from some rough backgrounds. Babies born with drugs in their system, etc... are commonly the children that are removed from their parents. This damage lasts a life time. 

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"10985",1964,"papadanku42",32,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

It's just riskier than having your own kid in terms of issues that the child could have.  "
"10990",1965,"papadanku42",32,16,1870,12,0,"I think the risk in any situation varies greatly and depends on each individiual situation.

Either because it seems fun, because you want to preserve your legacy, or whatever other reasons people can come up with, it's always going to be for your own benefit, not the child's. A child doesn't benefit from being born into this world."
"10999",1785,"papadanku42",32,13,1784,11,0,"Very interesting point. No one asks to be born. They are born due to the desire of the parent alone. I guess it is a long philosophical debate to talk about wether or not oen benefits from being born. "

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"11002",1788,"Grenyn",32,13,1787,4,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"11003",1789,"A1000eisn1",32,13,1788,6,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

All that just to add one more person to eventually hate their job and sit in a car 2 hours a day."
"11004",1790,"depression_is_fun",32,13,1788,3,0,"You have exactly the same views I have of basically not consenting to be born. You are bringing an new life into a world knowing full well there is a 100% chance it is going to experience pain, regret, sadness, sorrow, etc. Yes they will feel happiness and all that too, bit it isn't guaranteed to be because or illness across every spectrum, any form of assault or abuse, etc etc. There is someone already giving a not so desirable life (someone in foster care) that you could help have a great life. No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing. Like, think about Lincoln's decendents, or Hitler's, or Washingtons, are they somehow humanly better than any one else in the year 2019 that they somehow wouldn't have if instead if the having kids they were adopted???

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"11019",1805,"recovering_spaz",32,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

"11021",244,"IdlyCurious",32,4,243,14,0,"There's a lot of potential problems/issues with surrogacy, depending on where you live.  Some states are much more amenable to the process.

Certainly some countries do."
"11022",959,"thatonegirl127",32,7,243,4,0,"I know several surros/IPs and I can tell you that most any IP would much rather have their own child. Surrogacy is insanely expensive (though I'm betting so would this procedure), but you also have to deal with the stress of someone else carrying your baby. I've read of stories about very irresponsible, unqualified surros resulting in a miscarriage or failed transfer. Not to mention the legal aspects of things. Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

Pelvic structure is irrelevant, because a c-section would always be required with a transplanted uterus. C-sections were invented in the first place mainly for preganant women whose pelivic shape could threaten both her and her child's life during birth.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body. This is why organ transplantation is so relatively straightforward.

"11193",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",33,8,323,11,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "

For me, I cannot get past people feeling a need to have a baby, and I dont know whether the physiological burden that this need causes is worth all of the societal effort in terms of surrogates or uterine transplants, especially when there are children that have no family and just need some support and stability. I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

"11195",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",33,16,1879,6,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Every child has a risk of having a genetic defect, and at some point even an elevated risk is still acceptable over being unable to have the child at all.

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article. It doesn't apply to this situation, because here we know that the change came about as a result of the drastic change in environmental conditions the cells are being exposed to, and that said conditions are obviously non-carcinogenic in nature."

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "
"11329",1735,"papadanku42",33,13,648,15,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ?

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

It makes sense to me that agencies would double check that people can afford a kid before giving them one. Same goes for the home inspection. "
"11330",1946,"_Z_E_R_O",33,16,1735,40,0,"It makes a lot of sense, yes. I never said agencies were a bad thing. I have an adopted sibling, and my family went through an agency and had a good outcome.

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"11331",1947,"papadanku42",33,16,1946,20,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"11332",2041,"dont--panic",33,29,1947,6,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "
"11333",1948,"Seandrunkpolarbear",33,16,1946,7,0,"Seems to me that the real problem is that it is easier to get pregnant than get drivers license! (Seriously, people in my famly have no business raising children, but here we are)  "
"11334",652,"MacPho13",33,6,242,11,0,"A person should only adopt or foster if they want to. Not just because they cant have biological children or would have difficulty having them. Adopting and fostering comes with its own challenges.

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA. I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

Not to mention that a lot of those kids come from an abusive home life or a drug addicted mother. Even smoking cigarettes increases the risk of learning disability, ADHD and lowered IQ. People who adopt are taking on an unknown and have a much bigger risk of dealing with serious problems.

"11372",1763,"papadanku42",33,13,1762,5,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."

A lot of kids that need homes in an adoptive/foster situation come from some rough backgrounds. Babies born with drugs in their system, etc... are commonly the children that are removed from their parents. This damage lasts a life time. 

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"11374",1964,"papadanku42",33,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

"11388",1785,"papadanku42",33,13,1784,11,0,"Very interesting point. No one asks to be born. They are born due to the desire of the parent alone. I guess it is a long philosophical debate to talk about wether or not oen benefits from being born. "

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"11391",1788,"Grenyn",33,13,1787,5,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"11392",1789,"A1000eisn1",33,13,1788,5,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

All that just to add one more person to eventually hate their job and sit in a car 2 hours a day."

No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent.

I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

I can understand why a woman/couple wants to give birth herself to her own baby, so since science can now make this possible with a donated womb maybe there's no reason not to. Yet the part of me that is creeped out by the thought of transplanting a womb from a deceased woman makes me wonder why the couple would not just use IVF and a surrogate for the pregnancy. The baby would still be the product of their combined DNA, the only difference being who carried the baby to term. "
"11410",244,"IdlyCurious",33,4,243,15,0,"There's a lot of potential problems/issues with surrogacy, depending on where you live.  Some states are much more amenable to the process.

Certainly some countries do."
"11411",959,"thatonegirl127",33,7,243,4,0,"I know several surros/IPs and I can tell you that most any IP would much rather have their own child. Surrogacy is insanely expensive (though I'm betting so would this procedure), but you also have to deal with the stress of someone else carrying your baby. I've read of stories about very irresponsible, unqualified surros resulting in a miscarriage or failed transfer. Not to mention the legal aspects of things. Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

Pelvic structure is irrelevant, because a c-section would always be required with a transplanted uterus. C-sections were invented in the first place mainly for preganant women whose pelivic shape could threaten both her and her child's life during birth.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body. This is why organ transplantation is so relatively straightforward.

"11583",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",34,8,323,12,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

"11585",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",34,16,1879,7,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Every child has a risk of having a genetic defect, and at some point even an elevated risk is still acceptable over being unable to have the child at all.

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting.

&gt;It is possible for a mothers red blood cells to cross into the placenta or fetus during pregnancy. When this occurs, the mothers blood cells develop antibodies that can attack the newborns blood cells and cause jaundice. ... If an Rh incompatibility is found, an Rh-immune globulin treatment is administered about 28 weeks into the pregnancy. If the incompatibility is not detected, the newborn can develop severe jaundice leading to brain damage. "

This is only a risk for rhesus negative mothers carrying rhesus positive babies. If its the other way round or both are the same there is no issue.

Foster care adoptions can be fast and cheap but have a lot of red tape and a high failure rate. Not only that, but kids in foster care are much more likely to have psychological problems or developmental delays stemming from abuse or drug exposure. 

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

First of all, adoptions are expensive with the average cost being $25,000. Secondly, we wanted a baby, not a grown child which means the available pool of children to do adopted was even smaller and in higher demand. 

Adopting a child sounds like a great idea in theory. In practice unless you are wealthy, well-connected, or willing to adopt an older child, or child with physical/mental disabilities. It is difficult, expensive, and emotionally exhausting. "
"11719",1735,"papadanku42",34,13,648,14,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ? 

In response to the money aspect:

As far as I know it costs almost $250,000 to raise a kid  from 0-18 (in public school and not including college costs). Source: https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html

It makes sense to me that agencies would double check that people can afford a kid before giving them one. Same goes for the home inspection. "
"11720",1946,"_Z_E_R_O",34,16,1735,39,0,"It makes a lot of sense, yes. I never said agencies were a bad thing. I have an adopted sibling, and my family went through an agency and had a good outcome.

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"11721",1947,"papadanku42",34,16,1946,19,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"11722",2041,"dont--panic",34,29,1947,5,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why? Because the adopted or foster child has been through enough difficulty and possibly trauma in their lives. They are a child, NOT a doll.

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

Not to mention that a lot of those kids come from an abusive home life or a drug addicted mother. Even smoking cigarettes increases the risk of learning disability, ADHD and lowered IQ. People who adopt are taking on an unknown and have a much bigger risk of dealing with serious problems.

"11762",1763,"papadanku42",34,13,1762,3,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."

A lot of kids that need homes in an adoptive/foster situation come from some rough backgrounds. Babies born with drugs in their system, etc... are commonly the children that are removed from their parents. This damage lasts a life time. 

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"11764",1964,"papadanku42",34,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

"11778",1785,"papadanku42",34,13,1784,11,0,"Very interesting point. No one asks to be born. They are born due to the desire of the parent alone. I guess it is a long philosophical debate to talk about wether or not oen benefits from being born. "

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"11781",1788,"Grenyn",34,13,1787,4,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"11782",1789,"A1000eisn1",34,13,1788,5,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"11798",1805,"recovering_spaz",34,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them.

Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

Pelvic structure is irrelevant, because a c-section would always be required with a transplanted uterus. C-sections were invented in the first place mainly for preganant women whose pelivic shape could threaten both her and her child's life during birth.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body.

I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand.

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

"11975",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",35,16,1879,5,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

"12109",1735,"papadanku42",35,13,648,17,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ?

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"12111",1947,"papadanku42",35,16,1946,21,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"12112",2041,"dont--panic",35,29,1947,5,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

Not to mention that a lot of those kids come from an abusive home life or a drug addicted mother. Even smoking cigarettes increases the risk of learning disability, ADHD and lowered IQ. People who adopt are taking on an unknown and have a much bigger risk of dealing with serious problems.

"12152",1763,"papadanku42",35,13,1762,3,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."

A lot of kids that need homes in an adoptive/foster situation come from some rough backgrounds. Babies born with drugs in their system, etc... are commonly the children that are removed from their parents. This damage lasts a life time. 

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"12154",1964,"papadanku42",35,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"12171",1788,"Grenyn",35,13,1787,4,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"12172",1789,"A1000eisn1",35,13,1788,5,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"12188",1805,"recovering_spaz",35,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

The baby would still be the product of their combined DNA, the only difference being who carried the baby to term. "
"12190",244,"IdlyCurious",35,4,243,16,0,"There's a lot of potential problems/issues with surrogacy, depending on where you live.  Some states are much more amenable to the process.  Some states the bio mom has no rights at all until the surrogate lets the child be adopted by mom. I think some might have compensated surrogacy illegal, but am not positive on that.  Certainly some countries do."
"12191",959,"thatonegirl127",35,7,243,4,0,"I know several surros/IPs and I can tell you that most any IP would much rather have their own child. Surrogacy is insanely expensive (though I'm betting so would this procedure), but you also have to deal with the stress of someone else carrying your baby. I've read of stories about very irresponsible, unqualified surros resulting in a miscarriage or failed transfer. Not to mention the legal aspects of things. Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "
"12192",2043,"lizbunbun",35,29,959,2,0,"Also in some countries surrogacy is legal, but you can't pay them for their services. In Canada you can only reimburse the surrogate's expenses.  Doesn't exactly make for an abundance of willing participants."

Pelvic structure is irrelevant, because a c-section would always be required with a transplanted uterus. C-sections were invented in the first place mainly for preganant women whose pelivic shape could threaten both her and her child's life during birth.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body. This is why organ transplantation is so relatively straightforward. It's simply a matter of a blood type match and anti-rejection medication for the vast majority of organ transplantations, as it would be for a uterine transplant."

I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand.

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

"12366",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",36,16,1879,6,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

E.g. why a Tnf alpha inhibitor that doesn't cross the placenta (cimzia) is less of a big deal than other classes of immunosuppressants that act on different parts of the immune system."

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

"12500",1735,"papadanku42",36,13,648,16,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ?

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"12502",1947,"papadanku42",36,16,1946,18,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"12503",2041,"dont--panic",36,29,1947,4,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

 I just don't really understand why someone would raise a child with their DNA but not want to raise a child without that shared DNA. I did somewhat of a cost analysis in a previous comment, in which I basically concluded that the cost of adoption vs. childbirth are quite similar.

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

"12543",1763,"papadanku42",36,13,1762,1,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"12545",1964,"papadanku42",36,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"12562",1788,"Grenyn",36,13,1787,5,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"12563",1789,"A1000eisn1",36,13,1788,5,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend. 

I absolutely don't understand the DNA thing.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"12579",1805,"recovering_spaz",36,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "

Pelvic structure is irrelevant, because a c-section would always be required with a transplanted uterus. C-sections were invented in the first place mainly for preganant women whose pelivic shape could threaten both her and her child's life during birth.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body.

"12755",1027,"sewsewsewyourboat",37,8,323,13,0,"Well, the alternative if you want your own genetic child is surrogacy, which is usually pretty high in price, considering the toll pregnancy racks up on the body. I am assuming that since this was experimental, the price was waived for the recipient. 

Not to mention, with surrogacy, the mother won't be producing breast milk,  the surrogate would, and that person might not be interested in nursing.

AND this doesn't take into consideration the emotional toll the surrogate would feel toward the baby. The hormone rush, followed by losing the baby would be very emotionally scarring for some. So, there is just a lack of people even interested in being surrogates.

AND it is still even pricy to put those eggs into someone else. That's on top of the fees the surrogate would demand. 

There are reasons beyond ego, here. "

I am assuming, though, that caring for an adopted child would fulfill that emotional need in most cases, though I could certainly be wrong. It is also easy for me to say these things because my SO and I do not feel a need to have biological children and have the luxury to wait until we are financially stable and emotionally ready to adopt a child. Id like to understand this need more, but it is something that is difficult for me to empathize with and I would need to spend time with these types of people to really gain that ability.

"12757",1880,"sewsewsewyourboat",37,16,1879,6,0,"As you will eventually find out, adoption is a mine field of emotions. There will be mothers who back out of adoption agreements, the competition, and the high price of private adoptions. You talk about financial stability to adopt a child. Well, it'll be in the realm of 30k or higher. Some people in private organizations will offer but the mother more money than what you can provide. Plus lawyer fees and fees to the organisation. 

Or you become a foster parent to adopt and help out children who need you, and that... That is probably even worse because you'll have children who haven't had a stable home, and will need support and therapy, and you'll give it to them and you'll form a great bond... All to have it taken away from you because the state has decided it is best to put the child back in with the parents. This can go on for years.

When you look at the price of IVF being maybe around 10k, with some insurance, you begin to see why people opt that route. It has a 1/3 chance if working, iirc, so a lot of doctors will implant two embryos to increase the chances in the hope that one will survive. Sometimes you get two for the price of one. All within a much shorter time frame, too.

It's great and all to say you want to adopt, but it's really usually someone who has no clue about this kind of thing and is mostly posturing for virtue's sake."

She didnt have a functional part of her body, and this procedure allowed her to have one, if only for a short time. I dont see how thats ego-based at all.

Were not talking about breast augmentation or other cosmetic, superficial procedures. This is about someone wanting to have a family. Do we have an explicit *right* to reproduce? No. But I think its a fairly reasonable desire to have your own family, no matter the risk.

Another argument: if you could offer a real, flesh-and-bone leg to an amputee, does the risk of attaching this new leg outweigh the potentially marginal benefits of having a real leg instead of prosthetics? Barring from some transhumanist paradigm shift where prosthetics are considered better, I would think a real leg would be priceless to anyone that has lost one, and that desire to function as they did in the past is reasonable justification to undergo a risky procedure."

Plenty of parents get screened and elect to continue a pregnancy with a child knowing they have some defect like Down Syndrome. To them, the value of having a child at all is high, and they are willing to bear the burdens of such a child. Whether thats acceptable from the childs perspective is a very, *very* tough ethical dilemma that I dont think society has quite come to consensus on, and the eventual introduction of designer babies when gene editing becomes safe enough for human use is likely to change that discussion significantly."

Though interestingly enough, relatively recent advancements made in the techniques used to construct neo-vaginas (that's the proper medical term for them, no disrespect intended) utilizing tissue harvested from the [peritoneum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum) has actually been observed to undergo [metaplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia) and become exactly the same kind of stratified squamous epithelium found within a typical vagina. 

This is something believed to be possible due to the shared cellular parentage of the peritoneum and the [Mllerian ducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramesonephric_duct), the latter of which are a structure seen during embryonic development that goes on to form the uterus, uterine tubes, cervix, and most of the vagina in females.  
Or anyone without a sufficient quantity of AMH, the [anti-Mllerian hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), if you want to be technical about it.

The transformation doesn't *always* occur, so exactly what conditions induce it is still an area of active research, but yeah. I just figured I'd throw that out there, because it's kinda interesting. Great news for both transgender women and cisgender women suffering from conditions such as [MRKH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis)

**Edit:** Also, you can disregard all the talk about cancer and carcinogenesis present in the metaplasia wiki article.

If you adopt through a private agency you can avoid many of the foster care problems, but agencies generally only approve married heterosexual couples within a certain age range and income bracket who have been together for a long time and who are homeowners, not renters. They also make you go through multiple home inspections and psychological interviews, cost $5,000-$10,000 cash up front, and take a year or more. And after all that, they can still fail.

"12891",1735,"papadanku42",37,13,648,15,0,"Could you provide some sources for the claims you're making ?

Im just saying that the average cost of adoption is more than the average cost of pregnancy and childbirth, and also takes longer. No one is coming to inspect a pregnant womans home or make sure that she and her partner are married except in extreme circumstances. "
"12893",1947,"papadanku42",37,16,1946,18,0,"It definitely isn't this black and white. In the USA both biologically birthing a child or adopting one can be relatively cheap or quite expensive. If someone is struggling with fertility issues and has a complicated birth that adds tons of cost (IVF or other fertility treatments plus a C-section or complicstions drastically increase costs). Check it out:

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Childbirth can range from $8,000-15,000 on average to $30,000 if complications arise (they often do): https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't.

In your previous comment you stated that foster kids are more messed up. I don't think that is a fair assesment. Regardless of if you adopt or have a biological child, you cannot know if it will be healthy (physically and mentally) or will end up being a good person or not. "
"12894",2041,"dont--panic",37,29,1947,5,0,"It would already be a huge improvement if we had cheap, effective, safe and long-term birth control (both a male and female version too) with an easy way to remove or counter it. Then we could give it to everyone and whenever someone wanted to have a kid they would only need to go get it disabled/removed. Beyond that the least controversial restrictions would probably be to have a waiting period to make sure you're serious and to prevent teenagers from disabling it.

One potential risk is an increase in STD spreading because more people may have unsafe sex if there isn't any risk of pregnancy but that may be possible to mitigate eventually with education. "

If a women desires a biological child, if it is something they have dreamed of since they were a kid, an adopted or foster child may not fill that want. AND that is not fair to the adopted or foster child. It works out well for many families, but not all.

People rarely if ever say this to women who decide to have biological children. Why is that?! No one says, Well, you had one biological child. Stop there and now adopt or foster instead of getting pregnant again. 
See how ridiculous that sounds..

Everyone is free to make their own choice. If a woman wants to pursue having a biological child despite difficulties, that is her choice. She should not be shamed by anyone. Hopefully she has a strong support system around her. Since there are no guarantees shell be able to have a child. If she truly is unable to have a biological child and she decideds to adopt and or foster, that is her choice. (If in a relationship, hopefully their choice) No one can make that decision for a woman or person. It is a decision they need to make and one to not be taken lightly. Why?

You are correct in your cost analysis.  Since it's all expensive, why don't people ask couples who are having their own children why they didn't adopt or foster?  Why are they adding more children to the world when there are others that need a home? See what I mean? No one ever asks that but for some reason if you want to do the same thing as those couples, but have difficulty, then it's okay to ask.

Here's where we are currently, just to give some insight from a couple who is at this moment considering IVF, fostering, or adoption.  I'm focusing on the things that are different and scary from birthing your own baby.

Fostering: 
The goal of fostering is to hopefully reunite the child(ren) with their biological family, not adoption, though sometimes children are adopted.  There is a great need for people to take in sibling groups.  The children are typically older.  Many have experienced all kinds of different situations, including abuse and neglect, and typically need counseling and special care.  Some have special needs.  At the moment, we feel that we are not prepared, emotionally or intellectually, to rise to this challenge.  We've discussed seeing a counselor and talking to other couples who have done this, but the experience is far different than having a child of your own, who you never have to ""give back"" into perhaps a bad situation and you are aware of any and all things the child has gone though from day 1.  We would love to help a child but we would need to be capable of meeting their needs.  Still learning more about this.

Adoption: 
Most adoptions take years that we've checked into.  Also many request an open adoption where you and the child still have some kind of contact or communication with the family.  You also can't guarantee that the mother is taking care of herself (eating right, no drugs or alcohol, smoking) while pregnant.  So you feel a loss of control there (at least I do) and it's scary.  The child will likely have questions and may even feel upset about being adopted when they are older.  It's natural.  Of course giving a child a home is a wonderful thing but having your own child does not come with these things to navigate.

Having a biological child: 
I have one daughter.  If I did not have a child I would not feel the way I do about this now.  Still lots of things to be worried about.  No one is guaranteed a healthy baby.  It's not easy.  But you are always around to keep that baby as safe as you can.  You bond with them as you carry them.  They know you are their mother from the moment they are born and you continue to foster that bond throughout their life.  There is no one else.  And you never have to send them back.  I've never experienced the relationships that come from fostering or adopting so I can't speak to how they feel, but having my own child has been like no other experience I've ever had and I hope I'm blessed enough to experience it again.  

So to wrap up this LONG post, the experiences seem to be very different to me and all take special, wonderful people to be successful.  Having fertility problems doesn't qualify you to be a foster parent or adopt just like being able to have a baby doesn't automatically mean you are going to be a great parent."

"12934",1763,"papadanku42",37,13,1762,3,0,"Sure, but even a biological child is at risk of developing a disability or being mentally ill. I think wanting to be a parent, biological or adoptive, means that you have to accept that possibility."

It is wonderful that people adopt, but I think you know why a lot of people would rather not. It comes with a LOT of risk because of terrible parents who damaged their children in their most formative moments."
"12936",1964,"papadanku42",37,16,1764,2,0,"While I can understand why someone would worry about about pre-existing conditions, it is simply a risk you have to accept when having any child. If you have a biological child, you cannot screen for every possible disability or genetic condition. If you commit to adopting an unborn child you take the same risk. If you adopt an alreay born child, you can at least know they do not have physical disabilities. In both cases there is no way to know how the kid will turn out. I get that people worry about the health of their potential child but we shouldn't ignore that.

In the same vein, regardless of if you adopt or birth, you cannot know what type of person your child will turn out to be. You could be the best parent and give them all your life and they could still come out a serial killer, rapist, etc. 

In my opinion, wanting to be a parent means accepting that your child won't come out perfect and vowing to love them regardless."

"12950",1785,"papadanku42",37,13,1784,10,0,"Very interesting point. No one asks to be born. They are born due to the desire of the parent alone. I guess it is a long philosophical debate to talk about wether or not oen benefits from being born. "

&gt; you should have kids so you can GIVE them the best. 

That's the part that separates the selfishness. Being in a position to, and wanting to have a child so you can give them love and a good life is much less selfish than ""I want a son to pass in the family name of blah blah blah!"" Fuck those people. Those people are usually narcissists and usually just want the child to live in and follow in the footsteps they walked in or didn't walk in so that they can live vicariously through them. From the point the child is born they ate being raised in the image of what their parents wish they were and taking away the child's choice to be that they want to be. 

Not having a child reduces your carbon footprint to almost zilch compared to a person that has a child. Like others have said, just adopt. You are saving a child from a shit life, not adding to your carbon footprint, and can still have a family. So they don't have the same dna as you do...boo hoo. Why does that matter? It doesn't."
"12953",1788,"Grenyn",37,13,1787,5,0,"Sure, I don't disagree on there being layers. But I'm opposed to having children, full stop, because I never asked for it, and I wouldn't do it to someone else. No matter how much I could give them, you're still bringing this human into the world with the possibility of them experiencing a lot of pain, while someone who doesn't exist won't miss the beauty the world has to offer.

Adopting makes it better, of course. I wouldn't want to adopt either (I don't like kids, but there is also the thing about DNA, no matter how stupid it is), but at least it's usually a totally selfless act."
"12954",1789,"A1000eisn1",37,13,1788,5,0,"You sound like me. I can't imagine going to the lengths this lady went through just to give birth.

Thats selfish. This women got someone else's womb put into her, had to take medicine and wait for it to rot or not, then see if she could get pregnant, then carry the baby with an ungodly mystery amount of potential issues, then FINALLY she could give birth. 

Or ask a friend to be a surrogate, or adopt. Both would have been cheaper and faster.
She didn't go through all that because she wanted to give a child love. She did it because she wanted to experience giving birth and she wanted an extra bond with the child.

If she truly wanted to just be a mother she would have been fine with surrogate/adoption.

No it's not guaranteed, but they are already here so might as well help them. 

And yeah, I don't like kids either, plus I have major depressive disorder and dysthymia. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my cat, let alone a child. I got a vasectomy two years ago and it's been amazing. Highly recommend.

Cost of IVF is about $10,000-15,000: https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-does-ivf-cost-1960212

Cost of Adoption $10,000-30,000: https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-adopt/

These numbers hold true for those living in the USA with some form of health insurance(read the articles for detailed breakdowns). If you don't have health insurance it will likely be a lot more expensive. If you have good health insurance it could be cheaper. 

Going off these figures, I would say people shouldn't let money be the deciding factor on if they adopt or have a biological child (or both or neither). 

Also, I think it is important to recognize that just because you CAN have a biological child doesn't mean you SHOULD. I find it so incredibly sad that good people have to wait a long time and spend a lot of money to adopt a child if they want one, but any methhead or criminal could have one without anyone stopping them. I think it is a good think that new adoptive parents are vetted thoroughly. 

If every parent was vetted before being given or having a child, i'm sure we would see a drastic decline in rates of abandoned, abused and neglected children. On the other hand, I don't think it's a good idea to allow a government to gatekeep and decide who gets to be a parent and who doesn't."
"12970",1805,"recovering_spaz",37,13,242,1,0,"&gt; when there are millions of orphaned and foster kids who would love to have a family.

Eh not really.

Most kids in foster care aren't free to adopt. Their bio-parents still can regain custody if they prove they're competent. I've heard foster parents are lied to about easy it would be to adopt the kid. I can't imagine anything more heartbreaking than loving and nurturing a child, thinking you can protect them from what they've lived through, then having to send them back to the home previously deemed incompetent.

Those who are free to adopt have seen so much abuse and neglect tend have serious behavioral issues and would be a risk to hurt anyone in the home, parent, kid, or pet. A lot of their problems can't be ""loved away"" in the first month or so they've in the new home.

As far as international adoption goes, there are horror stories of kids being kidnapped from loving parents by human traffickers who charge people to adopt them. It's incredibly hard to vet which ones are legitimate and which ones are human trafficking rings. I don't say this to insult those who have adopted internationally it's a shit spot to be put in."

Surrogacy is outright illegal in some countries and states. Also, in some situations, the surro has ended up keeping the baby. 

Surrogacy and adoption can be a wonderful and beautiful thing. But there is also a lot of heartbreak and enormous amounts of stress. This procedure absolutely has risks of it's own, but gives those who have fertility troubles more say/control over what happens. "
"12974",2043,"lizbunbun",37,29,959,2,0,"Also in some countries surrogacy is legal, but you can't pay them for their services. In Canada you can only reimburse the surrogate's expenses.  Doesn't exactly make for an abundance of willing participants."

"12980",1608,"gracie_jay",37,12,248,6,0,"Essentially any single hormone or molecule produced in the human body can be synthesized into a bioidentical supplement. Many pregnant women take certain supplements, hormonal and nutritional, to better ensure stable and healthy pregnancy. I'm sure the woman in this article was one of them, for that matter.

Pelvic structure is irrelevant, because a c-section would always be required with a transplanted uterus. C-sections were invented in the first place mainly for preganant women whose pelivic shape could threaten both her and her child's life during birth.

As for organ shift, this mainly affects the intestine over a very gradual period of time. The intestine is obviously a very flexible organ. It can certainly cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but is rarely a serious issue due to the gradual nature of the uterus expanding. There is also no major biological difference between the vast majority of human internal organs, including their placement within the body. This is why organ transplantation is so relatively straightforward. It's simply a matter of a blood type match and anti-rejection medication for the vast majority of organ transplantations, as it would be for a uterine transplant."

We're all part of a genetic lineage stemming back to the first cell. Evolution has primed us for one purpose: to reproduce. It's the reason for being here.


I think having children is a form of denying your mortality. In some form, you'll live on, even if it's just DNA. I'm kinda really weird about this topic, tbh.
