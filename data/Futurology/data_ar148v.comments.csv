&gt; MODEL COMPLETION (MACHINE-WRITTEN, 5 TRIES)

&gt;
&gt; It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so many books and so much television and films tell us that it was the cause, that it has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of slavery. But thats not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War. Many people think of the war as about states rights. Youre not wrong about that, but its kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conflict between states rights and federalism. So lets try again. Whats the idea that has inspired so many people to go onto the battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic--a notion of limited government--is a great part of the history.

&gt;
&gt; MODEL COMPLETION (MACHINE-WRITTEN, 5 TRIES)
&gt; By Donny Ferguson
&gt;
&gt; It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so many books and so much television and films tell us that it was the cause, that it has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of slavery. But thats not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War. Many people think of the war as about states rights. Youre not wrong about that, but its kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conflict between states rights and federalism. So lets try again. Whats the idea that has inspired so many people to go onto the battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic--a notion of limited government--is a great part of the history.

&gt; MODEL COMPLETION (MACHINE-WRITTEN, 5 TRIES)
&gt; By Donny Ferguson
&gt;
&gt; It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so many books and so much television and films tell us that it was the cause, that it has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of slavery. But thats not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War. Many people think of the war as about states rights. Youre not wrong about that, but its kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conflict between states rights and federalism. So lets try again. Whats the idea that has inspired so many people to go onto the battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic--a notion of limited government--is a great part of the history.

&gt; MODEL COMPLETION (MACHINE-WRITTEN, 5 TRIES)

&gt; It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so many books and so much television and films tell us that it was the cause, that it has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of slavery. But thats not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War. Many people think of the war as about states rights. Youre not wrong about that, but its kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conflict between states rights and federalism. So lets try again. Whats the idea that has inspired so many people to go onto the battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic--a notion of limited government--is a great part of the history.

&gt;
&gt; MODEL COMPLETION (MACHINE-WRITTEN, 5 TRIES)
&gt; By Donny Ferguson
&gt;
&gt; It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so many books and so much television and films tell us that it was the cause, that it has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of slavery. But thats not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War. Many people think of the war as about states rights. Youre not wrong about that, but its kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conflict between states rights and federalism. So lets try again. Whats the idea that has inspired so many people to go onto the battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic--a notion of limited government--is a great part of the history.

&gt; For todays homework assignment, please describe the reasons for the US Civil War.
&gt;
&gt; MODEL COMPLETION (MACHINE-WRITTEN, 5 TRIES)
&gt; By Donny Ferguson
&gt;
&gt; It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so many books and so much television and films tell us that it was the cause, that it has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of slavery. But thats not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War. Many people think of the war as about states rights. Youre not wrong about that, but its kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conflict between states rights and federalism. So lets try again. Whats the idea that has inspired so many people to go onto the battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic--a notion of limited government--is a great part of the history.

They're already beating some models at their game with nearly no specialisation, just using old classifiers to correlate the internal representation with a task it's never been trained on.

&gt; For todays homework assignment, please describe the reasons for the US Civil War.
&gt;
&gt; MODEL COMPLETION (MACHINE-WRITTEN, 5 TRIES)
&gt; By Donny Ferguson
&gt;
&gt; It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so many books and so much television and films tell us that it was the cause, that it has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of slavery. But thats not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War. Many people think of the war as about states rights. Youre not wrong about that, but its kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conflict between states rights and federalism. So lets try again. Whats the idea that has inspired so many people to go onto the battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic--a notion of limited government--is a great part of the history.

&gt;
&gt; MODEL COMPLETION (MACHINE-WRITTEN, 5 TRIES)
&gt; By Donny Ferguson
&gt;
&gt; It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so many books and so much television and films tell us that it was the cause, that it has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of slavery. But thats not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War. Many people think of the war as about states rights. Youre not wrong about that, but its kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conflict between states rights and federalism. So lets try again. Whats the idea that has inspired so many people to go onto the battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic--a notion of limited government--is a great part of the history.

&gt; MODEL COMPLETION (MACHINE-WRITTEN, 5 TRIES)
&gt; By Donny Ferguson
&gt;
&gt; It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so many books and so much television and films tell us that it was the cause, that it has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of slavery. But thats not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War. Many people think of the war as about states rights. Youre not wrong about that, but its kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conflict between states rights and federalism. So lets try again. Whats the idea that has inspired so many people to go onto the battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic--a notion of limited government--is a great part of the history.

&gt; SYSTEM PROMPT (HUMAN-WRITTEN)
&gt; For todays homework assignment, please describe the reasons for the US Civil War.
&gt;
&gt; MODEL COMPLETION (MACHINE-WRITTEN, 5 TRIES)
&gt; By Donny Ferguson
&gt;
&gt; It is easy to identify why the Civil War happened, because so many people and so many books and so much television and films tell us that it was the cause, that it has something to do with race or economics or religion. There is much agreement that it was essentially a war of slavery on behalf of capitalism, about a century of slavery. But thats not what most people think of when they think of the Civil War. Many people think of the war as about states rights. Youre not wrong about that, but its kind of misleading to say that the Civil War was a conflict between states rights and federalism. So lets try again. Whats the idea that has inspired so many people to go onto the battlefields of Gettysburg and Antietam and Gettysberg and Petersburg and Fredericksburg? The American idea of the republic--a notion of limited government--is a great part of the history.

Thing is, this would cleanly beat every other language model if they specialise it for a given task. They're already beating some models at their game with nearly no specialisation, just using old classifiers to correlate the internal representation with a task it's never been trained on. If they train this a bit more on what makes a book/essay good and what makes it bad it would get perfect marks for sure."
