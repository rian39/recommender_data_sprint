In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent. That includes increases in France (2 percent), Germany (0.1 percent), and Spain (7 percent). Carbon emissions rose in a majority of European countries last year, [according to European Union data](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/european-renewables-are-up-so-are-carbon-emissions#gs.zQdZ26c).

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

I'm pro environment as well, but I wanted to take the opportunity to point out how ineffective environmental regulations actually are and how it sets the US at an uneven playing field.  I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations. Like so many other things in politics, words have become more valuable than deeds. And with no real mechanism to punish countries that cheat on this agreement, there's a chance that the Paris deal could lead to more environmental pollution, not less.

"76",27,"SGBotsford",4,3,25,1,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

After 9/11 they shut down boat access to the pond.  Later fishing access, and they closed the park.  Not all of the land was suitable for mining, but the expropriation process here is that if they need any of your land, they have to offer to buy out all of it.  

But bottom line was they didn't want anyone living on any part of the project, and indeed they bought out a 1/2 to 1 mile buffer around it.  In doing this it means that there is no 'cover activity'  ANYONE on the project is subject to being questioned.

The same thing would apply to a project like this.  If maintenance workers on the U.S. side are common, then all a wall jumper has to do is to have a set of coveralls that look like the workers.  All a 'coyote' has to do is have a pickup with a suitable logo to pick up wall jumpers."

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

Then again, its just my simple and kinda naive way of looking at headline.
Would it really be bad idea? How bad ? "
"129",26,"biglybrainbestwords",5,3,25,5,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."
"130",27,"SGBotsford",5,3,25,1,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

## Edit.  Why the science is clear:

Wind and solar subtract value beyond 3% market share due to inflexibility (supply cant be adjusted to demand) and unreliability (cloud fronts and lulls are unpredictable and cannot be avoided) which are geographically correlated (cloud cover, lulls, and sunsets affecting one site usually affect nearby sites), amplifying negative effects.  Tidal power is more reliable, but almost as uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.  Unless you want exploding energy prices, you can realistically do H3% solar, H3% wind, &amp; H4% tidal, but the other 90% has to be dammed hydro, nuclear fission, or fossil.

Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."

"209",27,"SGBotsford",6,3,25,2,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

Nice ad hominem.  I cited 2 sources.  Sorry if youre too galaxy-brained too understand them.  In simplistic terms that even an ad-hominem-addicted brainlet can understand:

The value factors of wind and solar drop below 1.0 beyond 3% market share due to inflexibility (supply cant be adjusted to varying demand) and unreliability (cloud fronts and lulls are unpredictable and cannot be avoided) which are geographically correlated (cloud cover, lulls, and sunsets affecting one site usually affect nearby sites), amplifying negative effects.  Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.  Unless you want exploding energy prices, you can realistically do H3% solar, H3% wind, &amp; H4% tidal, but the other 90% has to be dammed hydro, nuclear fission, or fossil."
"301",171,"StevenGannJr",7,7,170,1,0,"&gt; inflexibility (supply cant be adjusted to varying demand) 

What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal? Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

&gt; unreliability (cloud fronts and lulls are unpredictable and cannot be avoided)

How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly? Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

&gt;which are geographically correlated (cloud cover, lulls, and sunsets affecting one site usually affect nearby sites)

The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

&gt;Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

&gt;Unless you want exploding energy prices, you can realistically do H3% solar, H3% wind, &amp; H4% tidal, but the other 90% has to be dammed hydro, nuclear fission, or fossil.

Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy? Have you considered contacting the TVA to inform them of their ignorance of how to build a power grid? They're doing it all wrong, based on what you're saying."
"302",172,"CentiMaga",7,7,171,1,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.  Unless you want exploding energy prices, you can realistically do H3% solar, H3% wind, &amp; H4% tidal, but the other 90% has to be dammed hydro, nuclear fission, or fossil."

"419",229,"CentiMaga",8,8,173,1,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.

Texas (ERCOT) already had 19% of electricity produced from renewables in 2018, and has 40+GW of additional wind and 40+GW of additional solar far enough in the development pipeline to be registered with ERCOT.

And Texas has an almost entirely isolated grid, with about a quarter percent traded outside ERCOT - and the biggest connect is with SPP, which has an even higher percentage of wind power.

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

"435",144,"biglybrainbestwords",8,6,143,10,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."

* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

"553",229,"CentiMaga",9,8,173,1,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"554",295,"StevenGannJr",9,9,229,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads. If I remember properly it's related to 'Load Leveling', though I can't find the exact source I'm thinking of.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"703",354,"CentiMaga",10,10,353,3,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"704",355,"StevenGannJr",10,10,354,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

&amp;#x200B;

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.

The problem isn't immigrants are evil.  It is that a small number of immigrants are evil as fuck and give the rest a bad name.

The problem is that the solutions as a whole would work.  But some of the solutions are supported by Democrats and others are reviled by Democrats.  Other solutions are supported by Republicans and others are reviled by Republicans.  So I just get run over twice.

I would define our relationship with Mexico as a Frienemy. If we share energy generation with them we should be able to instantly be cut off from them and still support our citizens.  If not they certainly will use the shared project as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"860",354,"CentiMaga",11,10,353,3,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"861",355,"StevenGannJr",11,10,354,0,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

PV cells are as inflexible today as 20 years ago, solar is as unreliable at night as ever, wind turbines are unreliable in when the wind doesnt blow as ever, and the tides are as unresponsive to air-conditioning demands as ever.  Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.

Ive noted usa will be a leader in solar tech, but so will China.  I think its important to be realistic both ways - we cant simply shutdown all current power infrastructure.  Thats totally retarded.  Particularly nuclear.  

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

This satisfies all views and is achievable."
"872",399,"CentiMaga",11,11,398,1,0,"Im fine with allowing companies (and indeed I demand their right) to build solar.

(But thats a separate discussion and Im tired after hours of this, so lets just disagree.)

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

Its extremely high density compared to batteries, it has the potential to reverse global warming, its relatively safe to store (unlike hydrogen), it means car &amp; jet travel can be carbon-neutral, and our infrastructure is already well-adapted for it."
"873",361,"leapoffaith28",11,10,331,1,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"874",362,"CentiMaga",11,10,361,1,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."

* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.

TLDR: We can generate enough electricity but I currently believe that storage will soon become a important barrier that'll need to be overcome."

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.  Unless you want exploding energy prices, you can realistically do H3% solar, H3% wind, &amp; H4% tidal, but the other 90% has to be dammed hydro, nuclear fission, or fossil."

What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal? Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

&gt; unreliability (cloud fronts and lulls are unpredictable and cannot be avoided)

&gt;which are geographically correlated (cloud cover, lulls, and sunsets affecting one site usually affect nearby sites)

The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

"1042",354,"CentiMaga",12,10,353,4,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"1043",355,"StevenGannJr",12,10,354,0,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

&amp;#x200B;

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.

The problem isn't immigrants are evil.  It is that a small number of immigrants are evil as fuck and give the rest a bad name.

The problem is that the solutions as a whole would work.  But some of the solutions are supported by Democrats and others are reviled by Democrats.  Other solutions are supported by Republicans and others are reviled by Republicans.  So I just get run over twice.

I would define our relationship with Mexico as a Frienemy. If we share energy generation with them we should be able to instantly be cut off from them and still support our citizens.  If not they certainly will use the shared project as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

"1256",354,"CentiMaga",13,10,353,6,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"1257",355,"StevenGannJr",13,10,354,0,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

PV cells are as inflexible today as 20 years ago, solar is as unreliable at night as ever, wind turbines are unreliable in when the wind doesnt blow as ever, and the tides are as unresponsive to air-conditioning demands as ever.  Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.

Ive noted usa will be a leader in solar tech, but so will China.  I think its important to be realistic both ways - we cant simply shutdown all current power infrastructure.  Thats totally retarded.  Particularly nuclear.  

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads.

I'm pro environment as well, but I wanted to take the opportunity to point out how ineffective environmental regulations actually are and how it sets the US at an uneven playing field.  I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations. Like so many other things in politics, words have become more valuable than deeds. And with no real mechanism to punish countries that cheat on this agreement, there's a chance that the Paris deal could lead to more environmental pollution, not less.

"1481",342,"leapoffaith28",14,10,331,4,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"1482",343,"CentiMaga",14,10,342,0,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"1485",390,"leapoffaith28",14,11,389,1,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

PV cells are as inflexible today as 20 years ago, solar is as unreliable at night as ever, wind turbines are unreliable in when the wind doesnt blow as ever, and the tides are as unresponsive to air-conditioning demands as ever.  Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.

Ive noted usa will be a leader in solar tech, but so will China.  I think its important to be realistic both ways - we cant simply shutdown all current power infrastructure.  Thats totally retarded.  Particularly nuclear.  

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

The value factors of wind and solar drop below 1.0 beyond 3% market share due to inflexibility (supply cant be adjusted to varying demand) and unreliability (cloud fronts and lulls are unpredictable and cannot be avoided) which are geographically correlated (cloud cover, lulls, and sunsets affecting one site usually affect nearby sites), amplifying negative effects.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal? Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly? Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

&gt;which are geographically correlated (cloud cover, lulls, and sunsets affecting one site usually affect nearby sites)

How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

"1514",565,"CentiMaga",14,14,564,4,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"1515",566,"StevenGannJr",14,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

"1571",176,"biglybrainbestwords",14,7,175,22,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."

"1574",179,"SGBotsford",14,7,175,3,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

"1778",565,"CentiMaga",15,14,564,5,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"1779",566,"StevenGannJr",15,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

Of that 10.7 million, over half were from expired travel visas (a wall wouldn't have stopped them).

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

"1843",176,"biglybrainbestwords",15,7,175,22,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

"1895",468,"knowskarate",15,12,209,1,0,"&gt;Do y'all think immigrants are evil demon spawn or something? Who want to destroy all things American?

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.  

&amp;#x200B;

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

&amp;#x200B;

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.  

&amp;#x200B;

The problem isn't immigrants are evil.  It is that a small number of immigrants are evil as fuck and give the rest a bad name.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that the solutions as a whole would work.  But some of the solutions are supported by Democrats and others are reviled by Democrats.  Other solutions are supported by Republicans and others are reviled by Republicans.  So I just get run over twice.

I would define our relationship with Mexico as a Frienemy. If we share energy generation with them we should be able to instantly be cut off from them and still support our citizens.  If not they certainly will use the shared project as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations.

The wind doesn't blow as much and the sun doesn't shine as much during night, so unless we get a good storage medium I believe we'll be dependent on non-renewable sources of energy for a bit longer.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads. If I remember properly it's related to 'Load Leveling', though I can't find the exact source I'm thinking of.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"2038",344,"leapoffaith28",16,10,331,8,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"2039",345,"CentiMaga",16,10,344,1,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."

Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.

Ive noted usa will be a leader in solar tech, but so will China.  I think its important to be realistic both ways - we cant simply shutdown all current power infrastructure.  Thats totally retarded.  Particularly nuclear.  

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

Nice ad hominem.  I cited 2 sources.  Sorry if youre too enlightened to understand them.  In simplistic terms that even an ad-hominem-addicted brainlet could understand:

The value factors of wind and solar drop below 1.0 beyond 3% market share due to inflexibility (supply cant be adjusted to varying demand) and unreliability (cloud fronts and lulls are unpredictable and cannot be avoided) which are geographically correlated (cloud cover, lulls, and sunsets affecting one site usually affect nearby sites), amplifying negative effects.  Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.  Unless you want exploding energy prices, you can realistically do H3% solar, H3% wind, &amp; H4% tidal, but the other 90% has to be dammed hydro, nuclear fission, or fossil."

How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

&gt;Unless you want exploding energy prices, you can realistically do H3% solar, H3% wind, &amp; H4% tidal, but the other 90% has to be dammed hydro, nuclear fission, or fossil.

Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy? Have you considered contacting the TVA to inform them of their ignorance of how to build a power grid? They're doing it all wrong, based on what you're saying."
"2071",565,"CentiMaga",16,14,564,6,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"2072",566,"StevenGannJr",16,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

Then again, its just my simple and kinda naive way of looking at headline.
Would it really be bad idea? How bad ? "
"2139",176,"biglybrainbestwords",16,7,175,23,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."

"2142",179,"SGBotsford",16,7,175,3,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.

The wind doesn't blow as much and the sun doesn't shine as much during night, so unless we get a good storage medium I believe we'll be dependent on non-renewable sources of energy for a bit longer.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads. If I remember properly it's related to 'Load Leveling', though I can't find the exact source I'm thinking of.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations. Like so many other things in politics, words have become more valuable than deeds.

Assessing  the  solar  market  value  in  different  power  systems  is  a promising direction of future research.

If you're going to talk about rigor, then you need to read the papers you're going to cite.

Also, in each of the three papers /u/High_Speed_Idiot linked Hirth uses figures like 10-15%, 20%, and 15-30% (it's easy to find, simply click those papers and scroll to the conclusions to find the relevant figures).

"2334",344,"leapoffaith28",17,10,331,7,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"2335",345,"CentiMaga",17,10,344,1,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

"2367",565,"CentiMaga",17,14,564,7,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"2368",566,"StevenGannJr",17,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"2634",344,"leapoffaith28",18,10,331,6,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"2635",345,"CentiMaga",18,10,344,1,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Externalities are an economic factor, and are measured against the opportunity costs incurred by choosing an uneconomical option today. They measure favorably using the 4NCAs figures.  But Im tired of arguing with redditors for hours, sorry."

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"2638",348,"leapoffaith28",18,10,347,1,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture. 

&amp;#x200B;

The science and economics are clear. I would like to ask why you are so defensive on this position, because I really **do** care if you change your mind, and I'm disappointed that such an important topic evokes such a hostile response.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

"2659",774,"CentiMaga",18,18,773,7,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"2660",775,"StevenGannJr",18,18,774,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

The best case is that some dedicated cartel whips put some people to work digging a horribly fragile and unethical tunnel a few times every year.

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

"2732",144,"biglybrainbestwords",18,6,143,25,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."

* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads. If I remember properly it's related to 'Load Leveling', though I can't find the exact source I'm thinking of.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"2935",344,"leapoffaith28",19,10,331,7,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"2936",345,"CentiMaga",19,10,344,1,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"2939",348,"leapoffaith28",19,10,347,1,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy? Have you considered contacting the TVA to inform them of their ignorance of how to build a power grid? They're doing it all wrong, based on what you're saying."
"2960",774,"CentiMaga",19,18,773,6,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"2961",775,"StevenGannJr",19,18,774,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.

The wind doesn't blow as much and the sun doesn't shine as much during night, so unless we get a good storage medium I believe we'll be dependent on non-renewable sources of energy for a bit longer.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads. If I remember properly it's related to 'Load Leveling', though I can't find the exact source I'm thinking of.

TLDR: We can generate enough electricity but I currently believe that storage will soon become a important barrier that'll need to be overcome."

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations. Like so many other things in politics, words have become more valuable than deeds.

Assessing  the  solar  market  value  in  different  power  systems  is  a promising direction of future research.

If you're going to talk about rigor, then you need to read the papers you're going to cite.

Also, in each of the three papers /u/High_Speed_Idiot linked Hirth uses figures like 10-15%, 20%, and 15-30% (it's easy to find, simply click those papers and scroll to the conclusions to find the relevant figures).

"3237",344,"leapoffaith28",20,10,331,7,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"3238",345,"CentiMaga",20,10,344,1,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"3241",348,"leapoffaith28",20,10,347,1,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

"3262",774,"CentiMaga",20,18,773,8,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"3263",775,"StevenGannJr",20,18,774,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

The best analyses appear to suggest storage costs are drastically reducing but arent anywhere near economic for 100% scaling.

Ive noted usa will be a leader in solar tech, but so will China.  I think its important to be realistic both ways - we cant simply shutdown all current power infrastructure.  Thats totally retarded.  Particularly nuclear.  

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

Its extremely high density compared to batteries, it has the potential to reverse global warming, its relatively safe to store (unlike hydrogen), it means car &amp; jet travel can be carbon-neutral, and our infrastructure is already well-adapted for it."

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"3539",344,"leapoffaith28",21,10,331,8,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"3540",345,"CentiMaga",21,10,344,1,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Externalities are an economic factor, and are measured against the opportunity costs incurred by choosing an uneconomical option today. They measure favorably using the 4NCAs figures.  But Im tired of arguing with redditors for hours, sorry."
"3541",346,"leapoffaith28",21,10,345,6,0,"In case you get untired of being wrong: Your cited papers do not include externalities, and the Fourth National Climate Assessment to my reading does not either. It's a bold claim to say they ""measure favorably"", and you need to bring further proof."
"3542",347,"CentiMaga",21,10,346,2,0,"I never said they included AGW externalities.

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"3543",348,"leapoffaith28",21,10,347,1,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture. 

&amp;#x200B;

The science and economics are clear. I would like to ask why you are so defensive on this position, because I really **do** care if you change your mind, and I'm disappointed that such an important topic evokes such a hostile response. Perhaps instead of lashing out at anonymous redditors I hope you might reconsider what made you think this way.

"3564",774,"CentiMaga",21,18,773,6,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"3565",775,"StevenGannJr",21,18,774,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

You can see gas and electricity follow each other closely. This is because much of our electricity is generated using natural gas.  

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.

PV cells are as inflexible today as 20 years ago, solar is as unreliable at night as ever, wind turbines are unreliable in when the wind doesnt blow as ever, and the tides are as unresponsive to air-conditioning demands as ever.  Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

You could do with doing some research.

In 2016 there were 10.7 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in total or 3.3% of our population. Of that 10.7 million, over half were from expired travel visas (a wall wouldn't have stopped them). Of the remaining 5.35 million, only 3.3% were of South and Central American descent (once again, a wall wouldn't stop them).

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.  

&amp;#x200B;

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

&amp;#x200B;

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.  

&amp;#x200B;

The problem isn't immigrants are evil.  It is that a small number of immigrants are evil as fuck and give the rest a bad name.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that the solutions as a whole would work.  But some of the solutions are supported by Democrats and others are reviled by Democrats.  Other solutions are supported by Republicans and others are reviled by Republicans.  So I just get run over twice.  

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; (remember we aren't at war or anything)  

&amp;#x200B;

I would define our relationship with Mexico as a Frienemy. If we share energy generation with them we should be able to instantly be cut off from them and still support our citizens.  If not they certainly will use the shared project as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to energy security I don't think we should share with anybody. "

The wind doesn't blow as much and the sun doesn't shine as much during night, so unless we get a good storage medium I believe we'll be dependent on non-renewable sources of energy for a bit longer.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads. If I remember properly it's related to 'Load Leveling', though I can't find the exact source I'm thinking of.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"3843",344,"leapoffaith28",22,10,331,8,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"3844",345,"CentiMaga",22,10,344,1,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"3847",348,"leapoffaith28",22,10,347,1,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture. 

&amp;#x200B;

The science and economics are clear. I would like to ask why you are so defensive on this position, because I really **do** care if you change your mind, and I'm disappointed that such an important topic evokes such a hostile response.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly? Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"3870",775,"StevenGannJr",22,18,774,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.

PV cells are as inflexible today as 20 years ago, solar is as unreliable at night as ever, wind turbines are unreliable in when the wind doesnt blow as ever, and the tides are as unresponsive to air-conditioning demands as ever.  Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

Ive noted usa will be a leader in solar tech, but so will China.  I think its important to be realistic both ways - we cant simply shutdown all current power infrastructure.  Thats totally retarded.  Particularly nuclear.  

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

Would it really be bad idea? How bad ? "
"3945",144,"biglybrainbestwords",22,6,143,26,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."

* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

The wind doesn't blow as much and the sun doesn't shine as much during night, so unless we get a good storage medium I believe we'll be dependent on non-renewable sources of energy for a bit longer.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads. If I remember properly it's related to 'Load Leveling', though I can't find the exact source I'm thinking of.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"4149",344,"leapoffaith28",23,10,331,8,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"4150",345,"CentiMaga",23,10,344,3,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."

Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

"4178",565,"CentiMaga",23,14,564,8,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"4179",566,"StevenGannJr",23,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

You can see gas and electricity follow each other closely. This is because much of our electricity is generated using natural gas.  

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.  That seems like a pretty good plan, and doesn't even require energy storage.

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads. If I remember properly it's related to 'Load Leveling', though I can't find the exact source I'm thinking of.

TLDR: We can generate enough electricity but I currently believe that storage will soon become a important barrier that'll need to be overcome."

The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations. Like so many other things in politics, words have become more valuable than deeds.

"4456",344,"leapoffaith28",24,10,331,8,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"4457",345,"CentiMaga",24,10,344,1,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

"4485",565,"CentiMaga",24,14,564,6,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"4486",566,"StevenGannJr",24,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

Its extremely high density compared to batteries, it has the potential to reverse global warming, its relatively safe to store (unlike hydrogen), it means car &amp; jet travel can be carbon-neutral, and our infrastructure is already well-adapted for it."

The best case is that some dedicated cartel whips put some people to work digging a horribly fragile and unethical tunnel a few times every year.

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

"4558",144,"biglybrainbestwords",24,6,143,25,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent.

I'm pro environment as well, but I wanted to take the opportunity to point out how ineffective environmental regulations actually are and how it sets the US at an uneven playing field.  I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations. Like so many other things in politics, words have become more valuable than deeds. And with no real mechanism to punish countries that cheat on this agreement, there's a chance that the Paris deal could lead to more environmental pollution, not less.

"4765",344,"leapoffaith28",25,10,331,8,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"4766",345,"CentiMaga",25,10,344,2,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Externalities are an economic factor, and are measured against the opportunity costs incurred by choosing an uneconomical option today. They measure favorably using the 4NCAs figures.  But Im tired of arguing with redditors for hours, sorry."

"4768",347,"CentiMaga",25,10,346,2,0,"I never said they included AGW externalities.

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"4769",348,"leapoffaith28",25,10,347,1,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture. 

&amp;#x200B;

The science and economics are clear. I would like to ask why you are so defensive on this position, because I really **do** care if you change your mind, and I'm disappointed that such an important topic evokes such a hostile response. Perhaps instead of lashing out at anonymous redditors I hope you might reconsider what made you think this way.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal? Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy? Have you considered contacting the TVA to inform them of their ignorance of how to build a power grid? They're doing it all wrong, based on what you're saying."
"4794",565,"CentiMaga",25,14,564,5,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"4795",566,"StevenGannJr",25,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

You can see gas and electricity follow each other closely. This is because much of our electricity is generated using natural gas.  

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.  That seems like a pretty good plan, and doesn't even require energy storage.

"4811",445,"CentiMaga",25,12,444,3,1,"The analysis of electrical utility inflexibility and unreliability hasnt changed at all.

PV cells are as inflexible today as 20 years ago, solar is as unreliable at night as ever, wind turbines are unreliable in when the wind doesnt blow as ever, and the tides are as unresponsive to air-conditioning demands as ever.  Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."
"4812",446,"eigthgen",25,12,445,4,0,"But what has changed is battery efficiency, energy storage infrastructure and the addition of services like 3DFS to monitor the grids performance and mitigate charge loss.

Ive noted usa will be a leader in solar tech, but so will China.  I think its important to be realistic both ways - we cant simply shutdown all current power infrastructure.  Thats totally retarded.  Particularly nuclear.  

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

You could do with doing some research.

In 2016 there were 10.7 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in total or 3.3% of our population. Of that 10.7 million, over half were from expired travel visas (a wall wouldn't have stopped them). Of the remaining 5.35 million, only 3.3% were of South and Central American descent (once again, a wall wouldn't stop them).

The best case is that some dedicated cartel whips put some people to work digging a horribly fragile and unethical tunnel a few times every year. The worst is that they frequently damage the wall and it costs more to fix it for no true benefit. Not to mention it'll likely require moving people out of their homes in some places (probably with Eminent Domain which I am violently against as an incredible abuse of property rights) .

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

Would it really be bad idea? How bad ? "
"4869",176,"biglybrainbestwords",25,7,175,23,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."

* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.  

&amp;#x200B;

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

&amp;#x200B;

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.  

&amp;#x200B;

The problem isn't immigrants are evil.  It is that a small number of immigrants are evil as fuck and give the rest a bad name.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that the solutions as a whole would work.  But some of the solutions are supported by Democrats and others are reviled by Democrats.  Other solutions are supported by Republicans and others are reviled by Republicans.  So I just get run over twice.  

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; (remember we aren't at war or anything)  

&amp;#x200B;

I would define our relationship with Mexico as a Frienemy. If we share energy generation with them we should be able to instantly be cut off from them and still support our citizens.  If not they certainly will use the shared project as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to energy security I don't think we should share with anybody. "

The wind doesn't blow as much and the sun doesn't shine as much during night, so unless we get a good storage medium I believe we'll be dependent on non-renewable sources of energy for a bit longer.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads. If I remember properly it's related to 'Load Leveling', though I can't find the exact source I'm thinking of.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"5075",344,"leapoffaith28",26,10,331,7,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"5076",345,"CentiMaga",26,10,344,2,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"5079",348,"leapoffaith28",26,10,347,1,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture. 

&amp;#x200B;

The science and economics are clear. I would like to ask why you are so defensive on this position, because I really **do** care if you change your mind, and I'm disappointed that such an important topic evokes such a hostile response.

The value factors of wind and solar drop below 1.0 beyond 3% market share due to inflexibility (supply cant be adjusted to varying demand) and unreliability (cloud fronts and lulls are unpredictable and cannot be avoided) which are geographically correlated (cloud cover, lulls, and sunsets affecting one site usually affect nearby sites), amplifying negative effects.  Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

"5104",565,"CentiMaga",26,14,564,5,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"5105",566,"StevenGannJr",26,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

You can see gas and electricity follow each other closely. This is because much of our electricity is generated using natural gas.  

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.  That seems like a pretty good plan, and doesn't even require energy storage.

PV cells are as inflexible today as 20 years ago, solar is as unreliable at night as ever, wind turbines are unreliable in when the wind doesnt blow as ever, and the tides are as unresponsive to air-conditioning demands as ever.  Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

"5191",853,"biglybrainbestwords",26,26,269,23,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."

* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?

* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"5388",344,"leapoffaith28",27,10,331,9,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"5389",345,"CentiMaga",27,10,344,2,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"5392",348,"leapoffaith28",27,10,347,1,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

"5417",565,"CentiMaga",27,14,564,7,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"5418",566,"StevenGannJr",27,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

Then again, its just my simple and kinda naive way of looking at headline.
Would it really be bad idea? How bad ? "
"5504",853,"biglybrainbestwords",27,26,269,24,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."

"5507",856,"SGBotsford",27,26,269,4,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

The wind doesn't blow as much and the sun doesn't shine as much during night, so unless we get a good storage medium I believe we'll be dependent on non-renewable sources of energy for a bit longer.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads. If I remember properly it's related to 'Load Leveling', though I can't find the exact source I'm thinking of.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations. Like so many other things in politics, words have become more valuable than deeds.

If you're going to talk about rigor, then you need to read the papers you're going to cite.

Also, in each of the three papers /u/High_Speed_Idiot linked Hirth uses figures like 10-15%, 20%, and 15-30% (it's easy to find, simply click those papers and scroll to the conclusions to find the relevant figures).

"5702",344,"leapoffaith28",28,10,331,8,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"5703",345,"CentiMaga",28,10,344,2,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Externalities are an economic factor, and are measured against the opportunity costs incurred by choosing an uneconomical option today. They measure favorably using the 4NCAs figures.  But Im tired of arguing with redditors for hours, sorry."
"5704",346,"leapoffaith28",28,10,345,4,0,"In case you get untired of being wrong: Your cited papers do not include externalities, and the Fourth National Climate Assessment to my reading does not either. It's a bold claim to say they ""measure favorably"", and you need to bring further proof."
"5705",347,"CentiMaga",28,10,346,2,0,"I never said they included AGW externalities.

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"5706",348,"leapoffaith28",28,10,347,1,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture. 

&amp;#x200B;

The science and economics are clear. I would like to ask why you are so defensive on this position, because I really **do** care if you change your mind, and I'm disappointed that such an important topic evokes such a hostile response. Perhaps instead of lashing out at anonymous redditors I hope you might reconsider what made you think this way.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

"5731",565,"CentiMaga",28,14,564,7,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"5732",566,"StevenGannJr",28,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

You can see gas and electricity follow each other closely. This is because much of our electricity is generated using natural gas.  

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.  That seems like a pretty good plan, and doesn't even require energy storage.

PV cells are as inflexible today as 20 years ago, solar is as unreliable at night as ever, wind turbines are unreliable in when the wind doesnt blow as ever, and the tides are as unresponsive to air-conditioning demands as ever.  Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

Ive noted usa will be a leader in solar tech, but so will China.  I think its important to be realistic both ways - we cant simply shutdown all current power infrastructure.  Thats totally retarded.  Particularly nuclear.  

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads. If I remember properly it's related to 'Load Leveling', though I can't find the exact source I'm thinking of.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"6016",344,"leapoffaith28",29,10,331,8,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "

Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

"6045",565,"CentiMaga",29,14,564,7,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"6046",566,"StevenGannJr",29,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.

PV cells are as inflexible today as 20 years ago, solar is as unreliable at night as ever, wind turbines are unreliable in when the wind doesnt blow as ever, and the tides are as unresponsive to air-conditioning demands as ever.  Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"6330",344,"leapoffaith28",30,10,331,9,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

"6359",565,"CentiMaga",30,14,564,4,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"6360",566,"StevenGannJr",30,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

"6446",853,"biglybrainbestwords",30,26,269,22,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

The wind doesn't blow as much and the sun doesn't shine as much during night, so unless we get a good storage medium I believe we'll be dependent on non-renewable sources of energy for a bit longer.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.

"6586",929,"bileh",30,29,928,4,0,"No worries.  I'm pro environment as well, but I wanted to take the opportunity to point out how ineffective environmental regulations actually are and how it sets the US at an uneven playing field.  I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations. Like so many other things in politics, words have become more valuable than deeds. And with no real mechanism to punish countries that cheat on this agreement, there's a chance that the Paris deal could lead to more environmental pollution, not less.

If you're going to talk about rigor, then you need to read the papers you're going to cite.

"6644",344,"leapoffaith28",31,10,331,8,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"6645",345,"CentiMaga",31,10,344,0,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"6648",348,"leapoffaith28",31,10,347,1,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to ask why you are so defensive on this position, because I really **do** care if you change your mind, and I'm disappointed that such an important topic evokes such a hostile response.

"6673",565,"CentiMaga",31,14,564,7,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"6674",566,"StevenGannJr",31,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

You can see gas and electricity follow each other closely. This is because much of our electricity is generated using natural gas.  

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.  That seems like a pretty good plan, and doesn't even require energy storage.

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

"6759",853,"biglybrainbestwords",31,26,269,24,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

"6762",856,"SGBotsford",31,26,269,3,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

For most projects there is a sweet spot.  Increasing one aspect benefits to a point, but then creates costs on an additional aspect.

E.g.  Suppose you made a solar array 10 miles x 10 miles.  What colour are solar cells -- essentially black -- So any sunlight not converted to electricity gets converted to heat.  So now you have a rising column of hot air 10 miles across.  It reaches 3000 feet up, and creates a layer of cloud. You just cut your power generation in half.

That's an extreme example.  Here's another:  How long should an aisle be?  Make them short, and it makes it quick to service one panel and get out of there.  BUT you lose cells for the cross aisles.  Make them long, and you have to drive a long way to get to the place you can turn around.

How far apart should the rows be?  Too close, and in winter, one row shades the next.  Too far, and you have to buy more land.  Now if you can graze cows in the aisles, you may be willing to work with a wider aisle."

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

The problem is that the solutions as a whole would work.  But some of the solutions are supported by Democrats and others are reviled by Democrats.  Other solutions are supported by Republicans and others are reviled by Republicans.  So I just get run over twice.

I would define our relationship with Mexico as a Frienemy. If we share energy generation with them we should be able to instantly be cut off from them and still support our citizens.  If not they certainly will use the shared project as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"6958",344,"leapoffaith28",32,10,331,8,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"6959",345,"CentiMaga",32,10,344,0,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"6962",348,"leapoffaith28",32,10,347,1,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.  Unless you want exploding energy prices, you can realistically do H3% solar, H3% wind, &amp; H4% tidal, but the other 90% has to be dammed hydro, nuclear fission, or fossil."

&gt; unreliability (cloud fronts and lulls are unpredictable and cannot be avoided)

How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly? Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

&gt;which are geographically correlated (cloud cover, lulls, and sunsets affecting one site usually affect nearby sites)

The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

&gt;Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

&gt;Unless you want exploding energy prices, you can realistically do H3% solar, H3% wind, &amp; H4% tidal, but the other 90% has to be dammed hydro, nuclear fission, or fossil.

"6987",565,"CentiMaga",32,14,564,7,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"6988",566,"StevenGannJr",32,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

You can see gas and electricity follow each other closely. This is because much of our electricity is generated using natural gas.  

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.  That seems like a pretty good plan, and doesn't even require energy storage.

PV cells are as inflexible today as 20 years ago, solar is as unreliable at night as ever, wind turbines are unreliable in when the wind doesnt blow as ever, and the tides are as unresponsive to air-conditioning demands as ever.  Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

"7073",853,"biglybrainbestwords",32,26,269,25,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."

"7076",856,"SGBotsford",32,26,269,4,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

"7078",937,"SGBotsford",32,31,857,1,0,"You have all the other criteria too.  

For most projects there is a sweet spot.  Increasing one aspect benefits to a point, but then creates costs on an additional aspect.

E.g.  Suppose you made a solar array 10 miles x 10 miles.  What colour are solar cells -- essentially black -- So any sunlight not converted to electricity gets converted to heat.  So now you have a rising column of hot air 10 miles across.  It reaches 3000 feet up, and creates a layer of cloud. You just cut your power generation in half.

That's an extreme example.  Here's another:  How long should an aisle be?  Make them short, and it makes it quick to service one panel and get out of there.  BUT you lose cells for the cross aisles.  Make them long, and you have to drive a long way to get to the place you can turn around.

How far apart should the rows be?  Too close, and in winter, one row shades the next.  Too far, and you have to buy more land.  Now if you can graze cows in the aisles, you may be willing to work with a wider aisle."

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"7272",344,"leapoffaith28",33,10,331,8,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"7273",345,"CentiMaga",33,10,344,2,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."

Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

"7301",565,"CentiMaga",33,14,564,4,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"7302",566,"StevenGannJr",33,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

"7390",856,"SGBotsford",33,26,269,3,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

"7392",937,"SGBotsford",33,31,857,1,0,"You have all the other criteria too.  

For most projects there is a sweet spot.  Increasing one aspect benefits to a point, but then creates costs on an additional aspect.

E.g.  Suppose you made a solar array 10 miles x 10 miles.  What colour are solar cells -- essentially black -- So any sunlight not converted to electricity gets converted to heat.  So now you have a rising column of hot air 10 miles across.  It reaches 3000 feet up, and creates a layer of cloud. You just cut your power generation in half.

That's an extreme example.  Here's another:  How long should an aisle be?  Make them short, and it makes it quick to service one panel and get out of there.  BUT you lose cells for the cross aisles.  Make them long, and you have to drive a long way to get to the place you can turn around.

How far apart should the rows be?  Too close, and in winter, one row shades the next.  Too far, and you have to buy more land.  Now if you can graze cows in the aisles, you may be willing to work with a wider aisle."

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.

The wind doesn't blow as much and the sun doesn't shine as much during night, so unless we get a good storage medium I believe we'll be dependent on non-renewable sources of energy for a bit longer.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads. If I remember properly it's related to 'Load Leveling', though I can't find the exact source I'm thinking of.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"7586",344,"leapoffaith28",34,10,331,9,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"7587",345,"CentiMaga",34,10,344,3,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."

Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

"7615",565,"CentiMaga",34,14,564,6,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"7616",566,"StevenGannJr",34,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

You can see gas and electricity follow each other closely. This is because much of our electricity is generated using natural gas.  

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.

Wind is very predictable, so we can know a few hours in advance at least (and often several days) when we need to spool up a plant to start burning some dino-gas."

PV cells are as inflexible today as 20 years ago, solar is as unreliable at night as ever, wind turbines are unreliable in when the wind doesnt blow as ever, and the tides are as unresponsive to air-conditioning demands as ever.  Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

The best analyses appear to suggest storage costs are drastically reducing but arent anywhere near economic for 100% scaling.

Ive noted usa will be a leader in solar tech, but so will China.  I think its important to be realistic both ways - we cant simply shutdown all current power infrastructure.  Thats totally retarded.  Particularly nuclear.  

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

This satisfies all views and is achievable."

(But thats a separate discussion and Im tired after hours of this, so lets just disagree.)

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

Its extremely high density compared to batteries, it has the potential to reverse global warming, its relatively safe to store (unlike hydrogen), it means car &amp; jet travel can be carbon-neutral, and our infrastructure is already well-adapted for it."

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

"7704",856,"SGBotsford",34,26,269,4,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

For most projects there is a sweet spot.  Increasing one aspect benefits to a point, but then creates costs on an additional aspect.

E.g.  Suppose you made a solar array 10 miles x 10 miles.  What colour are solar cells -- essentially black -- So any sunlight not converted to electricity gets converted to heat.  So now you have a rising column of hot air 10 miles across.  It reaches 3000 feet up, and creates a layer of cloud. You just cut your power generation in half.

That's an extreme example.  Here's another:  How long should an aisle be?  Make them short, and it makes it quick to service one panel and get out of there.  BUT you lose cells for the cross aisles.  Make them long, and you have to drive a long way to get to the place you can turn around.

How far apart should the rows be?  Too close, and in winter, one row shades the next.  Too far, and you have to buy more land.  Now if you can graze cows in the aisles, you may be willing to work with a wider aisle."

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent. That includes increases in France (2 percent), Germany (0.1 percent), and Spain (7 percent).

I'm pro environment as well, but I wanted to take the opportunity to point out how ineffective environmental regulations actually are and how it sets the US at an uneven playing field.  I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations. Like so many other things in politics, words have become more valuable than deeds. And with no real mechanism to punish countries that cheat on this agreement, there's a chance that the Paris deal could lead to more environmental pollution, not less.

But bottom line was they didn't want anyone living on any part of the project, and indeed they bought out a 1/2 to 1 mile buffer around it.  In doing this it means that there is no 'cover activity'  ANYONE on the project is subject to being questioned.

"7900",344,"leapoffaith28",35,10,331,9,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"7901",345,"CentiMaga",35,10,344,2,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."

Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

"7929",565,"CentiMaga",35,14,564,8,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"7930",566,"StevenGannJr",35,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.

"8015",853,"biglybrainbestwords",35,26,269,23,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

"8018",856,"SGBotsford",35,26,269,4,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

"8020",937,"SGBotsford",35,31,857,1,0,"You have all the other criteria too.  

For most projects there is a sweet spot.  Increasing one aspect benefits to a point, but then creates costs on an additional aspect.

E.g.  Suppose you made a solar array 10 miles x 10 miles.  What colour are solar cells -- essentially black -- So any sunlight not converted to electricity gets converted to heat.  So now you have a rising column of hot air 10 miles across.  It reaches 3000 feet up, and creates a layer of cloud. You just cut your power generation in half.

That's an extreme example.  Here's another:  How long should an aisle be?  Make them short, and it makes it quick to service one panel and get out of there.  BUT you lose cells for the cross aisles.  Make them long, and you have to drive a long way to get to the place you can turn around.

How far apart should the rows be?  Too close, and in winter, one row shades the next.  Too far, and you have to buy more land.  Now if you can graze cows in the aisles, you may be willing to work with a wider aisle."

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.

The problem isn't immigrants are evil.  It is that a small number of immigrants are evil as fuck and give the rest a bad name.

The problem is that the solutions as a whole would work.  But some of the solutions are supported by Democrats and others are reviled by Democrats.  Other solutions are supported by Republicans and others are reviled by Republicans.  So I just get run over twice.

The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent. That includes increases in France (2 percent), Germany (0.1 percent), and Spain (7 percent).

My point wasn't to bring a Trump shitstorm here.  It's just to bring up the fact that I don't think Trump would consider this idea.  He wants what he wants.

I'm pro environment as well, but I wanted to take the opportunity to point out how ineffective environmental regulations actually are and how it sets the US at an uneven playing field.  I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations. Like so many other things in politics, words have become more valuable than deeds. And with no real mechanism to punish countries that cheat on this agreement, there's a chance that the Paris deal could lead to more environmental pollution, not less.

After 9/11 they shut down boat access to the pond.  Later fishing access, and they closed the park.  Not all of the land was suitable for mining, but the expropriation process here is that if they need any of your land, they have to offer to buy out all of it.  

But bottom line was they didn't want anyone living on any part of the project, and indeed they bought out a 1/2 to 1 mile buffer around it.  In doing this it means that there is no 'cover activity'  ANYONE on the project is subject to being questioned.

The same thing would apply to a project like this.  If maintenance workers on the U.S. side are common, then all a wall jumper has to do is to have a set of coveralls that look like the workers.  All a 'coyote' has to do is have a pickup with a suitable logo to pick up wall jumpers."

Assessing  the  solar  market  value  in  different  power  systems  is  a promising direction of future research.

If you're going to talk about rigor, then you need to read the papers you're going to cite.

Also, in each of the three papers /u/High_Speed_Idiot linked Hirth uses figures like 10-15%, 20%, and 15-30% (it's easy to find, simply click those papers and scroll to the conclusions to find the relevant figures).

"8214",344,"leapoffaith28",36,10,331,8,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"8215",345,"CentiMaga",36,10,344,1,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Externalities are an economic factor, and are measured against the opportunity costs incurred by choosing an uneconomical option today. They measure favorably using the 4NCAs figures.  But Im tired of arguing with redditors for hours, sorry."

"8217",347,"CentiMaga",36,10,346,2,0,"I never said they included AGW externalities.

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"8218",348,"leapoffaith28",36,10,347,3,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture. 

&amp;#x200B;

The science and economics are clear. I would like to ask why you are so defensive on this position, because I really **do** care if you change your mind, and I'm disappointed that such an important topic evokes such a hostile response. Perhaps instead of lashing out at anonymous redditors I hope you might reconsider what made you think this way.

"8243",565,"CentiMaga",36,14,564,6,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"8244",566,"StevenGannJr",36,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

You can see gas and electricity follow each other closely. This is because much of our electricity is generated using natural gas.  

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.  That seems like a pretty good plan, and doesn't even require energy storage.

PV cells are as inflexible today as 20 years ago, solar is as unreliable at night as ever, wind turbines are unreliable in when the wind doesnt blow as ever, and the tides are as unresponsive to air-conditioning demands as ever.  Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."
"8260",446,"eigthgen",36,12,445,4,0,"But what has changed is battery efficiency, energy storage infrastructure and the addition of services like 3DFS to monitor the grids performance and mitigate charge loss.

Ive noted usa will be a leader in solar tech, but so will China.  I think its important to be realistic both ways - we cant simply shutdown all current power infrastructure.  Thats totally retarded.  Particularly nuclear.  

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

You could do with doing some research.

In 2016 there were 10.7 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in total or 3.3% of our population. Of that 10.7 million, over half were from expired travel visas (a wall wouldn't have stopped them). Of the remaining 5.35 million, only 3.3% were of South and Central American descent (once again, a wall wouldn't stop them).

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

"8329",853,"biglybrainbestwords",36,26,269,24,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

"8332",856,"SGBotsford",36,26,269,4,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

"8334",937,"SGBotsford",36,31,857,1,0,"You have all the other criteria too.  

For most projects there is a sweet spot.  Increasing one aspect benefits to a point, but then creates costs on an additional aspect.

E.g.  Suppose you made a solar array 10 miles x 10 miles.  What colour are solar cells -- essentially black -- So any sunlight not converted to electricity gets converted to heat.  So now you have a rising column of hot air 10 miles across.  It reaches 3000 feet up, and creates a layer of cloud. You just cut your power generation in half.

That's an extreme example.  Here's another:  How long should an aisle be?  Make them short, and it makes it quick to service one panel and get out of there.  BUT you lose cells for the cross aisles.  Make them long, and you have to drive a long way to get to the place you can turn around.

How far apart should the rows be?  Too close, and in winter, one row shades the next.  Too far, and you have to buy more land.  Now if you can graze cows in the aisles, you may be willing to work with a wider aisle."

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.  

&amp;#x200B;

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

&amp;#x200B;

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.  

&amp;#x200B;

The problem isn't immigrants are evil.  It is that a small number of immigrants are evil as fuck and give the rest a bad name.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that the solutions as a whole would work.  But some of the solutions are supported by Democrats and others are reviled by Democrats.  Other solutions are supported by Republicans and others are reviled by Republicans.  So I just get run over twice.

I would define our relationship with Mexico as a Frienemy. If we share energy generation with them we should be able to instantly be cut off from them and still support our citizens.  If not they certainly will use the shared project as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations.

The wind doesn't blow as much and the sun doesn't shine as much during night, so unless we get a good storage medium I believe we'll be dependent on non-renewable sources of energy for a bit longer.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads. If I remember properly it's related to 'Load Leveling', though I can't find the exact source I'm thinking of.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

And with no real mechanism to punish countries that cheat on this agreement, there's a chance that the Paris deal could lead to more environmental pollution, not less.

Assessing  the  solar  market  value  in  different  power  systems  is  a promising direction of future research.

If you're going to talk about rigor, then you need to read the papers you're going to cite.

Also, in each of the three papers /u/High_Speed_Idiot linked Hirth uses figures like 10-15%, 20%, and 15-30% (it's easy to find, simply click those papers and scroll to the conclusions to find the relevant figures).

"8528",344,"leapoffaith28",37,10,331,9,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"8529",345,"CentiMaga",37,10,344,2,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Externalities are an economic factor, and are measured against the opportunity costs incurred by choosing an uneconomical option today. They measure favorably using the 4NCAs figures.  But Im tired of arguing with redditors for hours, sorry."

"8531",347,"CentiMaga",37,10,346,2,0,"I never said they included AGW externalities.

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"8532",348,"leapoffaith28",37,10,347,4,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture. 

&amp;#x200B;

The science and economics are clear. I would like to ask why you are so defensive on this position, because I really **do** care if you change your mind, and I'm disappointed that such an important topic evokes such a hostile response. Perhaps instead of lashing out at anonymous redditors I hope you might reconsider what made you think this way.

The value factors of wind and solar drop below 1.0 beyond 3% market share due to inflexibility (supply cant be adjusted to varying demand) and unreliability (cloud fronts and lulls are unpredictable and cannot be avoided) which are geographically correlated (cloud cover, lulls, and sunsets affecting one site usually affect nearby sites), amplifying negative effects.

"8557",565,"CentiMaga",37,14,564,4,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"8558",566,"StevenGannJr",37,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

You can see gas and electricity follow each other closely. This is because much of our electricity is generated using natural gas.  

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

It's a \*wall\*, not a heavily guarded military post  or a minefield. The best case is that some dedicated cartel whips put some people to work digging a horribly fragile and unethical tunnel a few times every year. The worst is that they frequently damage the wall and it costs more to fix it for no true benefit. Not to mention it'll likely require moving people out of their homes in some places (probably with Eminent Domain which I am violently against as an incredible abuse of property rights) .

It's not really feasible to build solar or wind or hydro in many places in the northern half of the country. 

You need good wind conditions and a good climate for wind. You need sun for solar. You need a proper location for hydro too. 

It is what it is.

What? You do know what country has the highest proportion of wind power in the world, right? Denmark. About a third of the energy wind produces comes from offshore installments.

&gt; It's mechanical so the cold weather would cause problems.

Okaaay? More than no wind? I doubt it. There are windmills in the northern-most part of mainland Norway; below freezing majority of the year, and indeed has a higher output in the winter.

Unless below freezing, no. Availability of resource will be the far bigger factor.

"8642",9,"fancyhatman18",37,2,1,242,0,"So the idea is to take all of our vital infrastructure and place it right next to an unsecured border?

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

Then again, its just my simple and kinda naive way of looking at headline.
Would it really be bad idea? How bad ? "
"8646",853,"biglybrainbestwords",37,26,269,24,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."

"8649",856,"SGBotsford",37,26,269,4,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."
"8650",857,"OriginalSophist",37,26,856,2,0,"That makes sense. Thank you!

Regarding ""string vs blob"" argument: 
How about string of blobs? For clumping efficiency
Wouldn't that also make it easier with planning road/logistics?

Then again, im just theory crafting.
Lets assume it would work- what would be the best clump size and distance inbetween, in your opinion?"
"8651",937,"SGBotsford",37,31,857,1,0,"You have all the other criteria too.  

For most projects there is a sweet spot.  Increasing one aspect benefits to a point, but then creates costs on an additional aspect.

E.g.  Suppose you made a solar array 10 miles x 10 miles.  What colour are solar cells -- essentially black -- So any sunlight not converted to electricity gets converted to heat.  So now you have a rising column of hot air 10 miles across.  It reaches 3000 feet up, and creates a layer of cloud. You just cut your power generation in half.

That's an extreme example.  Here's another:  How long should an aisle be?  Make them short, and it makes it quick to service one panel and get out of there.  BUT you lose cells for the cross aisles.  Make them long, and you have to drive a long way to get to the place you can turn around.

How far apart should the rows be?  Too close, and in winter, one row shades the next.  Too far, and you have to buy more land.  Now if you can graze cows in the aisles, you may be willing to work with a wider aisle."
"8652",858,"SPOOFE",37,26,269,5,0,"&gt; isnt Mexico/Usa border a perfect place for solar panels? 

No. While theres ample space and sunlight, the same can be said for millions of square miles that ARENT also right on the border, and a lot of those areas dont require thousands of miles of road built to get there."
"8653",859,"_BreakingGood_",37,26,269,2,0,"Its probably a good place for solar panels, but really you would get more bang for your buck just making a proper solar field on flat ground 500 feet from the border than trying to attach them into some sort of wall. "

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"8846",344,"leapoffaith28",38,10,331,9,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"8847",345,"CentiMaga",38,10,344,1,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Externalities are an economic factor, and are measured against the opportunity costs incurred by choosing an uneconomical option today. They measure favorably using the 4NCAs figures.  But Im tired of arguing with redditors for hours, sorry."

"8849",347,"CentiMaga",38,10,346,2,0,"I never said they included AGW externalities.

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"8850",348,"leapoffaith28",38,10,347,4,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture. 

&amp;#x200B;

The science and economics are clear. I would like to ask why you are so defensive on this position, because I really **do** care if you change your mind, and I'm disappointed that such an important topic evokes such a hostile response.

The value factors of wind and solar drop below 1.0 beyond 3% market share due to inflexibility (supply cant be adjusted to varying demand) and unreliability (cloud fronts and lulls are unpredictable and cannot be avoided) which are geographically correlated (cloud cover, lulls, and sunsets affecting one site usually affect nearby sites), amplifying negative effects.  Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.  Unless you want exploding energy prices, you can realistically do H3% solar, H3% wind, &amp; H4% tidal, but the other 90% has to be dammed hydro, nuclear fission, or fossil."
"8869",559,"TomTX",38,14,443,13,0,"Except reality trumps all of your false narrative.

What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal? Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

&gt; unreliability (cloud fronts and lulls are unpredictable and cannot be avoided)

How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly? Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

&gt;which are geographically correlated (cloud cover, lulls, and sunsets affecting one site usually affect nearby sites)

The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

&gt;Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

&gt;Unless you want exploding energy prices, you can realistically do H3% solar, H3% wind, &amp; H4% tidal, but the other 90% has to be dammed hydro, nuclear fission, or fossil.

Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy? Have you considered contacting the TVA to inform them of their ignorance of how to build a power grid? They're doing it all wrong, based on what you're saying."
"8876",565,"CentiMaga",38,14,564,5,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"8877",566,"StevenGannJr",38,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Im not smartassing. My limited knowledge to how it actually looks science-wise could be summarized by 1 episode of Breaking Bad.

To me, it looks like it could create massive energy infrastructure.
Create jobs, (or relocate coal mining people)

... And ( as farfetched) maybe open possibility for cooperation between countries. Both could profit.

"8965",853,"biglybrainbestwords",38,26,269,22,0,"Well so in theory it isn't the worst idea, though sharing energy between two countries having one unified infrastructure can definitely lead to power balance issues. Say the US builds most of it and we get a president like Trump later on who says, ""Hmm, yeah so I need Mexico to pay for whatever I believe will curb illegal immigration, and if they don't I'll turn off their power."" 


So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."

"8968",856,"SGBotsford",38,26,269,4,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

"8970",937,"SGBotsford",38,31,857,1,0,"You have all the other criteria too.  

For most projects there is a sweet spot.  Increasing one aspect benefits to a point, but then creates costs on an additional aspect.

E.g.  Suppose you made a solar array 10 miles x 10 miles.  What colour are solar cells -- essentially black -- So any sunlight not converted to electricity gets converted to heat.  So now you have a rising column of hot air 10 miles across.  It reaches 3000 feet up, and creates a layer of cloud. You just cut your power generation in half.

That's an extreme example.  Here's another:  How long should an aisle be?  Make them short, and it makes it quick to service one panel and get out of there.  BUT you lose cells for the cross aisles.  Make them long, and you have to drive a long way to get to the place you can turn around.

How far apart should the rows be?  Too close, and in winter, one row shades the next.  Too far, and you have to buy more land.  Now if you can graze cows in the aisles, you may be willing to work with a wider aisle."

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

"9164",344,"leapoffaith28",39,10,331,8,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"9165",345,"CentiMaga",39,10,344,4,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."

Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

I would like to ask why you are so defensive on this position, because I really **do** care if you change your mind, and I'm disappointed that such an important topic evokes such a hostile response.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

"9194",565,"CentiMaga",39,14,564,7,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"9195",566,"StevenGannJr",39,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar. Your intention to fix the problem is definitely in the right place, it's just a matter of how to go about that solution in a secure and cost-efficient manner."

"9286",856,"SGBotsford",39,26,269,5,0,"Solar is getting cheaper, but it's still marginal.  Considerations for solar PV site:  


* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

Regarding ""string vs blob"" argument: 
How about string of blobs? For clumping efficiency

Lets assume it would work- what would be the best clump size and distance inbetween, in your opinion?"
"9288",937,"SGBotsford",39,31,857,1,0,"You have all the other criteria too.  

For most projects there is a sweet spot.  Increasing one aspect benefits to a point, but then creates costs on an additional aspect.

E.g.  Suppose you made a solar array 10 miles x 10 miles.  What colour are solar cells -- essentially black -- So any sunlight not converted to electricity gets converted to heat.  So now you have a rising column of hot air 10 miles across.  It reaches 3000 feet up, and creates a layer of cloud. You just cut your power generation in half.

That's an extreme example.  Here's another:  How long should an aisle be?  Make them short, and it makes it quick to service one panel and get out of there.  BUT you lose cells for the cross aisles.  Make them long, and you have to drive a long way to get to the place you can turn around.

How far apart should the rows be?  Too close, and in winter, one row shades the next.  Too far, and you have to buy more land.  Now if you can graze cows in the aisles, you may be willing to work with a wider aisle."

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.

The wind doesn't blow as much and the sun doesn't shine as much during night, so unless we get a good storage medium I believe we'll be dependent on non-renewable sources of energy for a bit longer.

Now the demand spikes are relevant to this storage problem - During the day you'd likely have renewable produce a larger portion of the electricity but at night you'd have to increase production from NG and coal - both of which operate better under constant loads. If I remember properly it's related to 'Load Leveling', though I can't find the exact source I'm thinking of.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations. Like so many other things in politics, words have become more valuable than deeds.

"9482",344,"leapoffaith28",40,10,331,9,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "
"9483",345,"CentiMaga",40,10,344,3,0,"Nuclear fissions fixed costs come almost entirely from useless regulatory overhead (a fun recent example: verifying that the computer clocks of the computers of construction equipment work by paying someone to watch them uninterrupted for 24 hours).

Externalities are an economic factor, and are measured against the opportunity costs incurred by choosing an uneconomical option today. They measure favorably using the 4NCAs figures.  But Im tired of arguing with redditors for hours, sorry."

"9485",347,"CentiMaga",40,10,346,2,0,"I never said they included AGW externalities.

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Using reliable sources (e.g. the 4NCA, the EIAs NEMS), youll find that the latter is over an order of magnitude greater than the former.  Or dont.  I dont care."
"9486",348,"leapoffaith28",40,10,347,3,0,"It's a ridiculous task for one person to do as you suggest: (the 4NCA is mostly qualitative effects to date and in the near future, and NEMS is restricted to energy systems and [only forecasts to 2030](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/nems/overview/index.html).) Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

The science and economics are clear. I would like to ask why you are so defensive on this position, because I really **do** care if you change your mind, and I'm disappointed that such an important topic evokes such a hostile response.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

"9512",565,"CentiMaga",40,14,564,4,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"9513",566,"StevenGannJr",40,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

Surprising to learn the Trump administration is anti-coal. How is the current administration hurting coal plants in the USA?"

You can see gas and electricity follow each other closely. This is because much of our electricity is generated using natural gas.  

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.  That seems like a pretty good plan, and doesn't even require energy storage.  Wind is very predictable, so we can know a few hours in advance at least (and often several days) when we need to spool up a plant to start burning some dino-gas."

PV cells are as inflexible today as 20 years ago, solar is as unreliable at night as ever, wind turbines are unreliable in when the wind doesnt blow as ever, and the tides are as unresponsive to air-conditioning demands as ever.  Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.  Without economical utility-scale energy storage (currently orders of magnitude too costly), their applicability is limited."

Ive noted usa will be a leader in solar tech, but so will China.  I think its important to be realistic both ways - we cant simply shutdown all current power infrastructure.  Thats totally retarded.  Particularly nuclear.  

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

For most projects there is a sweet spot.  Increasing one aspect benefits to a point, but then creates costs on an additional aspect.

E.g.  Suppose you made a solar array 10 miles x 10 miles.  What colour are solar cells -- essentially black -- So any sunlight not converted to electricity gets converted to heat.  So now you have a rising column of hot air 10 miles across.  It reaches 3000 feet up, and creates a layer of cloud. You just cut your power generation in half.

That's an extreme example.  Here's another:  How long should an aisle be?  Make them short, and it makes it quick to service one panel and get out of there.  BUT you lose cells for the cross aisles.  Make them long, and you have to drive a long way to get to the place you can turn around.

How far apart should the rows be?  Too close, and in winter, one row shades the next.  Too far, and you have to buy more land.  Now if you can graze cows in the aisles, you may be willing to work with a wider aisle."

Let's look at Elon Musk. What I would say many hold up as a gold standard of free market innovation:

https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent.

I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations.

Assessing  the  solar  market  value  in  different  power  systems  is  a promising direction of future research.

If you're going to talk about rigor, then you need to read the papers you're going to cite.

"9801",344,"leapoffaith28",41,10,331,7,0,"This is a fundamental misunderstanding of energy policy.

First, as far I can find, nowhere does Hirth say that utility scale energy storage is ""absurdly uneconomical"". I think it's rather accepted in the energy community that solar and wind need to paired with energy storage, and a huge amount of research is being poured into developing better technology which are being demonstrated right now like the Tesla batteries in Australia. It's obvious that renewables are a technology in their infancy, but as economies of scale kick in and we start finding better ways to store technology during off peak hours the price will drop significantly. 

Secondly, being economical is not always what is best for our planet. It's 'uneconomical' to make cars have catalytic converters and smog emission limits from strictly the car manufacturer's standpoint, but it benefits us in an indirect way that the straight economics [do not account for](http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php).  If you're such a cheerleader for science, you would surely understand that science says that limiting our emissions with renewable technology is necessary to prevent drastic effects on the planet.

Third, nuclear fission is even more wildly uneconomical than wind and solar.

Finally, science is a conversation where many people come to a consensus from multiple sources. Lion Hirth is one person publishing one paper with one set of models, and for you to take one line (from an economics paper!) and say ""the science is settled"" is absurd. "

Explaining things to lazy/angry/slow/insane redditors is tiresome and boring.  Figure it out yourself.  Heres how:

Determine the annual GDP cost in 2100 due to global warming per °C (assuming 2.8 °C).  Now consider all climate interventions (i.e. banning coal, mandating EVs, etc) replaced by an equivalent CO2 fee-and-dividend (theyre economically equivalent), and determine the cumulative opportunity cost in lost GDP by 2100 for preventing each °C (assuming 2.8 °C with no tax).

Even the best economists struggle to make predictions a decade out, let alone 80 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, some teams have done as you suggest^(1,2). These are not the only studies, but every one I could find says that the cost of limiting our emissions to 1.5 degrees is far less than allowing the earth to warm by 2 degrees or more. However, I do admit that it is cost ineffective to try to reduce the warming much below 1.5 degrees through methods as carbon capture.

Tidal power is more reliable, but still uneconomical due to inflexibility.

Nuclear fission and dammed hydro are the only scalably economical non-fossil energy sources, and most good hydro sites are already dammed.

"9831",565,"CentiMaga",41,14,564,4,0,"&gt; What makes wind and solar less flexible than coal?

Great question!  Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand.  (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!)  Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

&gt; Also, why are coal plants being shut down and phased out as uneconomical and replaced with more modern alternatives like wind and solar? 

Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US).  Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

&gt; Why are the energy companies in America and nearly every other developed nation unaware of science?

They aren't.

&gt; How are existing power grids able to function when plants have to shut down unexpectedly?

Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

&gt; Why are backup plants no longer a viable solution like they have been for the past 50+ years?

They are, but they must be flexible and reliable.  Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

&gt; The nuclear plant I used to live near sent the majority of its power up to Georgia while plants in Georgia, as part of the nationwide power grid planning and organization. Why does this become impossible with cheaper renewable power?

It doesn't.  Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand.  For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

&gt; How are tides less flexible than coal deposits?

Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation.  The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid.  Humans cannot alter how fast the tides change.

&gt; Then why are coal companies continuing to phase out fossil fuel plants in favor of renewable energy?

Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.  Germany is terminating its nuclear reactors, despite their German-tier safety, flexibility, and reliability. It now imports and exports huge amounts of electricity at great cost. This wasn't economical, yet it happened."
"9832",566,"StevenGannJr",41,14,565,1,0,"&gt; Great question! Coal reactors and nuclear reactors can be spun up or down in 10's of minutes to match power demand. (Gas reactors and dammed-hydroelectric turbines in seconds!) Wind turbines and solar cells output a fixed power regardless of how much the grid demands.

Did you know that not all power produced by wind and solar needs to be consumed, though? And since the output is indeed fixed, the response to demand is instant as opposed to waiting for a plant to spin up.

Did you know also that dammed-hydroelectric generation is just as fixed as wind and solar, as there's no way to increase rainfall in response to energy demand?

&gt;Because governments are forcing them to close, both by law (e.g. Germany, England, Scotland) and with increasingly expensive regulations (e.g. the US). Coal didn't suddenly become naturally expensive.

Well shucks, I didn't realize the Trump administration was making coal more expensive. You'd think the rolling back of Bush-era EPA regulations would have helped.

Also, the decrease in coal profitability isn't a sudden thing. The cost to produce and use coal has been steadily increasing, staved off largely by automating more and more jobs away. The decrease in coal profitability has become a more significant issue recently because solar and wind have become more profitable.

In a free Capitalist economy, firms will make business decisions based off maximizing profit. These firms are transitioning away from coal in order to maximize their profits.

&gt;Power grids are interconnected and typically have flexible, reliable base-load generators (coal, gas, nuclear, and dammed-hydroelectric) that are easily capable of covering an outage by adjusting production.

Wouldn't this negate the concerns over inflexible energy sources? If the grid can cover for outages by adjusting production with coal, why can't it do the same for wind and solar?

&gt;Solar, wind, and tidal cannot adjust their baseline production, because humans cannot alter how bright the sun shines, how often clouds cover the sky, how fast the wind blows, or how quickly the tides move.

Did you know that humans cannot alter rainfall to increase hydroelectric power either, nor can they change the heat output of burning coal?

&gt;They are, but they must be flexible and reliable. Additional solar plants don't help when the Earth rotates, nor do additional wind turbines when the wind stops, and such outages tend to be geographically correlated (dramatically increasing transmission costs) unlike coal/gas/nuclear/dam outages.

How are non-solar and non-wind power plants effected at night or during lulls? Surely the existence of wind and solar doesn't preclude other types of energy production.

&gt;It doesn't. Nuclear (like coal, gas, and dammed hydroelectic) is both reliable and flexible, and capable of covering as much as 80% of the grid's electrical demand. For the reasons of inflexibility and unreliability mentioned above, solar, wind, and tidal are limited to 3%-4%.

How are humans able to alter the energy produced by uranium fission? Aren't thermonuclear reactors pretty rigidly bound to however much energy is produced by the reaction, and unable to alter that?

And how are the tides and sun unreliable compared to the rain necessary for hydroelectric power?

&gt;Coal deposits nothing to do with ""flexibility"" in the context of electricity generation. The coal feed rates and turbine speeds in a coal reactor can be altered in tens of minutes to meet the wildlyvarying power demands of the grid. 

Sure, but then when a plant is at capacity how can it respond to increase in demand?

&gt;Because governments intervene for arbitrary and often foolish reasons.

There's certainly no rapid increase in UK energy price due to the onset of renewables. If anything, I'd expect to see a fall in price as renewables are cheaper to operate and they don't require natural gas supply.

You speak of the capacity factor of wind, but models have been made that show if we were to install just over 300% of the wind power that we need, we'd only need to rely on natural gas for a couple of days a year.

Constraints like these are what determine the marginal value of increasing a given market share.

Flexibility (ability to adjust supply) and reliability (freedom from unpredictably interruptions) are critical for utility-scale energy production, and solar, wind, and tidal fail at this.

The best analyses appear to suggest storage costs are drastically reducing but arent anywhere near economic for 100% scaling.

Ive noted usa will be a leader in solar tech, but so will China.  I think its important to be realistic both ways - we cant simply shutdown all current power infrastructure.  Thats totally retarded.  Particularly nuclear.  

Its also strategically, environmentally and economically retarded to bag solar, and suggest that because it cant take 100% of Capacity, we should ignore it.

The sensible thing to do, is to replace coal with solar as quickly as capacity and costs realistically allow without tanking output, and invest sufficient r&amp;d into solar tech to not fall behind china.

This satisfies all views and is achievable."

Personally I hope carbon-fixation energy storage (i.e. synthesizing artificial methane and hydrocarbons/gasoline-like fuels with excess energy) becomes economical first.

Its extremely high density compared to batteries, it has the potential to reverse global warming, its relatively safe to store (unlike hydrogen), it means car &amp; jet travel can be carbon-neutral, and our infrastructure is already well-adapted for it."

So that's one issue. The territory itself is probably great for several renewable sources, but it is a contested territory between border patrol and cartel members. Although drug smuggling occurs mostly in our ports, there is still a pretty decent business of Cartel members smuggling people into and out of the US. The presence of the Cartel kind of makes the whole project dubious, as again that leads to what could be a security exploit if we are lax on border security.


To me, it seems that it creates more need for border security and more tension between countries. Though the intent is of course well founded, the consequences may not be so harmonious.

Edit- All the upsides too (creating jobs, improving infrastructure) could also be applied to other parts of the US. Where I live in Arizona we get 40+ mph winds and constant sunlight at high elevation, so it's a great location for wind/solar.

* Is a suitable parcel of land available?  Soil conditions for foundations.  Number of different owners to negotiate with? Price of land?  (Nothing drives up the price faster than knowing you've got a middle piece in a block.)
* Is it the right shape?  A blob of land is more efficient for wiring, construction and maintenance than a long string of land.  
* Is it close to a trunk power line for distribution?
* Is it close to a transportation nexus to minimize transport costs.
* Is it close to other PV arrays?  This will mean that there are existing contractors who can handle installation and maintenance.

Wind has some of the same siting issues, but also some different ones.  In rough land, you want to put turbines on top of hills and ridges.  Being flat is easier for PV, since more standarized parts are used.  PV is difficult for construction and maintenance on steep slopes.

 

It's not unreasonable to put both on the same land parcel if it's suitable.  Turbines need to be about 10 diameters apart (about 3000 feet for the largest ones)  to not interfere with each other.  The actual construction area is about an acre."

For most projects there is a sweet spot.  Increasing one aspect benefits to a point, but then creates costs on an additional aspect.

E.g.  Suppose you made a solar array 10 miles x 10 miles.  What colour are solar cells -- essentially black -- So any sunlight not converted to electricity gets converted to heat.  So now you have a rising column of hot air 10 miles across.  It reaches 3000 feet up, and creates a layer of cloud. You just cut your power generation in half.

That's an extreme example.  Here's another:  How long should an aisle be?  Make them short, and it makes it quick to service one panel and get out of there.  BUT you lose cells for the cross aisles.  Make them long, and you have to drive a long way to get to the place you can turn around.

How far apart should the rows be?  Too close, and in winter, one row shades the next.  Too far, and you have to buy more land.  Now if you can graze cows in the aisles, you may be willing to work with a wider aisle."

Elon Musk was able to do what he did because our government effectively sponsored his ideas. Our government needs to be funded to fund important initiatives from private companies willing to deal with climate change. Either the government itself does the work, or private companies do. At the end of the day though, the government still needs $$$ to facilitate that. You can't just, for instance, replace all of our existing energy infrastructure by just relying on the free market. There are way too many giant players in the way of making that a much much more difficult process.

Nuclear power should be seen as a stop gap, nothing more. It should not be something that we rely too heavily upon. Our best bet is funding initiatives that improve our current infrastructure and by incentivizing companies through governmental loans to use that updated infrastructure to begin installing renewable energy nodes.

Edit: Here's a link for further reading on what the Department of Energy does. It would facilitate something exactly like I just outlined. Also it's written by the guy who wrote Moneyball.

As a Republican large numbers of immigrants overstay visa's and I don't really care....because they are prescreened, non-violent, working in jobs that pay income taxes.  I think government reforms should be implemented to change their status from Illegal to legal.  If you looked close here it's going to be mostly government imposed time limits that cause them to be ""illegal"".  If you look closer you see the #1 nationality of people who overstay visa are Canadians.  

&amp;#x200B;

There are also criminal elements mainly in the drug mafias that cross the border illegally and cause all types of pain and suffering for US citizens.  I think there are better solutions which are more cost effective than a wall to solve this issue.  We should try them first before building a wall.

&amp;#x200B;

There are also citizens that see a better life in the US and cross the border illegal but lead normal lives in our communities.  Once again I don't think a wall is the solution.

The problem isn't immigrants are evil.  It is that a small number of immigrants are evil as fuck and give the rest a bad name.

The problem is that the solutions as a whole would work.  But some of the solutions are supported by Democrats and others are reviled by Democrats.  Other solutions are supported by Republicans and others are reviled by Republicans.  So I just get run over twice.

I would define our relationship with Mexico as a Frienemy. If we share energy generation with them we should be able to instantly be cut off from them and still support our citizens.  If not they certainly will use the shared project as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations.

Or something...)  Setup a government workforce that works multi-generations to complete the canal?

I know it's a lofty goal.  I believe that with enough labor and enough time we can accomplish anything.  So the question is really about whether or not the geography would make it possible.  The internet says 63% of the border is the Rio Grande river, so we could just work with that if we pull out of the treaty.  The mountains in California taper off just before the border so it would work on that side.  I haven't yet found if there's any geography that would make it impossible to dig a border canal.

In contrast, emissions are rising in Europe and much of the rest of the world. According to the BP data, Europes carbon dioxide emissions rose 92 million tons, or 2.5 percent. That includes increases in France (2 percent), Germany (0.1 percent), and Spain (7 percent). Carbon emissions rose in a majority of European countries last year, [according to European Union data](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/european-renewables-are-up-so-are-carbon-emissions#gs.zQdZ26c).

I'm pro environment as well, but I wanted to take the opportunity to point out how ineffective environmental regulations actually are and how it sets the US at an uneven playing field.  I do believe this is why Trump has been rolling back these regulations and withdrawing from international deals more so than his distaste for the environment.

For instance when we look at the Paris deal which is designed like an OPEC production quota, it's really hard to enforce and cheating is likely to be rampant. As many experts analyzing the agreement have noted, there are no explicit enforcement mechanisms in the accord. So [nothing would happen to a country that even just ignored its contribution commitments.](https://reason.com/blog/2017/05/04/should-president-trump-cancel-the-paris) That leaves the countries that are more likely to adhere to the climate deal rules, like the U.S., at a distinct economic and political disadvantage.

It appears that the supposed triumph of the Paris agreement is that every nation coming into it [publicly acknowledged the reality and challenges of climate change](http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-paris-climate-deal-whats-in-it-and-what-does-it-mean/410776/)coming into the negotiations. Like so many other things in politics, words have become more valuable than deeds. And with no real mechanism to punish countries that cheat on this agreement, there's a chance that the Paris deal could lead to more environmental pollution, not less.

After 9/11 they shut down boat access to the pond.  Later fishing access, and they closed the park.  Not all of the land was suitable for mining, but the expropriation process here is that if they need any of your land, they have to offer to buy out all of it.  

But bottom line was they didn't want anyone living on any part of the project, and indeed they bought out a 1/2 to 1 mile buffer around it.  In doing this it means that there is no 'cover activity'  ANYONE on the project is subject to being questioned.

The same thing would apply to a project like this.  If maintenance workers on the U.S. side are common, then all a wall jumper has to do is to have a set of coveralls that look like the workers.  All a 'coyote' has to do is have a pickup with a suitable logo to pick up wall jumpers."
