Your personality is a mixture of your senses working with your brain to make a seemingly seamless experience. We don't even get raw data, our brain ""edits"" the footage. That, mixed with X number of years not dying, what you've learned and experienced has led to what you identify as your personality. 

Take that limited perception and attempt to classify, regulate and apply law on the nature of reality, or be taught from the time you were an infant on ""how it is"", and you've got yourself a pretty heavy illusion you're living in. 

It's nice though. Being everything for eternity would be hard. Being a part of everything is a little more fun. Everything is waves, patterns, and vibrations. And you get to experience everything in every way. It's why death is safe, and meaning not meant to be defined. We're just supposed to be here, and do our thing. "

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much. Baseball, science class, the asshole old people who always yelled at us for cutting through their yard, etc. 

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail. 

We shook hands and said we need to catch up more often. I told him to tell everyone in the old gang that I turned out alright.

Take that limited perception and attempt to classify, regulate and apply law on the nature of reality, or be taught from the time you were an infant on ""how it is"", and you've got yourself a pretty heavy illusion you're living in. 

It's nice though. Being everything for eternity would be hard. Being a part of everything is a little more fun. Everything is waves, patterns, and vibrations.

Start with a low resolution image to determine what elements (pixels) are common among all faces. Gradually increase resolution as the routine learns then generate new (fake) images based on the common elements.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much.

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail. 

We shook hands and said we need to catch up more often. I told him to tell everyone in the old gang that I turned out alright.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail.

Gradually increase resolution as the routine learns then generate new (fake) images based on the common elements.

Right now, assuming these are uniquely generated (and not stored server-side), I could just take one and use it for anything. Well, legally I can't, but practically I could.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

Your personality is a mixture of your senses working with your brain to make a seemingly seamless experience. We don't even get raw data, our brain ""edits"" the footage. That, mixed with X number of years not dying, what you've learned and experienced has led to what you identify as your personality. 

Take that limited perception and attempt to classify, regulate and apply law on the nature of reality, or be taught from the time you were an infant on ""how it is"", and you've got yourself a pretty heavy illusion you're living in. 

It's nice though. Being everything for eternity would be hard. Being a part of everything is a little more fun. Everything is waves, patterns, and vibrations.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much. Baseball, science class, the asshole old people who always yelled at us for cutting through their yard, etc. 

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail. 

We shook hands and said we need to catch up more often. I told him to tell everyone in the old gang that I turned out alright. 

Fun night.  "

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

When someone buys you gold or platinum, you also receive Reddit coins that can be used to gild other users. Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response."

Right now, assuming these are uniquely generated (and not stored server-side), I could just take one and use it for anything. Well, legally I can't, but practically I could.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much. Baseball, science class, the asshole old people who always yelled at us for cutting through their yard, etc. 

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail. 

We shook hands and said we need to catch up more often. I told him to tell everyone in the old gang that I turned out alright.

Start with a low resolution image to determine what elements (pixels) are common among all faces. Gradually increase resolution as the routine learns then generate new (fake) images based on the common elements.

Right now, assuming these are uniquely generated (and not stored server-side), I could just take one and use it for anything. Well, legally I can't, but practically I could.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts.

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail.

Curious you decide to cycle through the years and start to find them eerily accurate. Down to the location of pimples during your teenage years. You find all of this amusing until you decide to check what you'll look like 5 years from now. But for some reason no face is generated. "

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much.

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail. 

We shook hands and said we need to catch up more often. I told him to tell everyone in the old gang that I turned out alright.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts.

When someone buys you gold or platinum, you also receive Reddit coins that can be used to gild other users. Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

Edit: Thank you for the gold and silver, folks. ;)"

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected.

Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much.

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail.

Gradually increase resolution as the routine learns then generate new (fake) images based on the common elements.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected.

When someone buys you gold or platinum, you also receive Reddit coins that can be used to gild other users. Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much. Baseball, science class, the asshole old people who always yelled at us for cutting through their yard, etc. 

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail. 

We shook hands and said we need to catch up more often. I told him to tell everyone in the old gang that I turned out alright.

2) backgrounds? The backgrounds often seem ok at first glance, but you can't make sense of them if you try.

Right now, assuming these are uniquely generated (and not stored server-side), I could just take one and use it for anything. Well, legally I can't, but practically I could.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

When someone buys you gold or platinum, you also receive Reddit coins that can be used to gild other users. Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

Edit: Thank you for the gold and silver, folks. ;)"

Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much.

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail. 

We shook hands and said we need to catch up more often. I told him to tell everyone in the old gang that I turned out alright.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much.

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail. 

We shook hands and said we need to catch up more often. I told him to tell everyone in the old gang that I turned out alright.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

When someone buys you gold or platinum, you also receive Reddit coins that can be used to gild other users. Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

Edit: Thank you for the gold and silver, folks. ;)"

Gradually increase resolution as the routine learns then generate new (fake) images based on the common elements.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much. Baseball, science class, the asshole old people who always yelled at us for cutting through their yard, etc. 

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail. 

We shook hands and said we need to catch up more often. I told him to tell everyone in the old gang that I turned out alright.

Start with a low resolution image to determine what elements (pixels) are common among all faces. Gradually increase resolution as the routine learns then generate new (fake) images based on the common elements.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

The script will be generated based on data collected by services like Netflix to cater to a specific audience narrow or wide. The voices will be synthetic and the images cg indistinguishable from real life. They'll just churn out film after film that people will definitely enjoy and love at insanely low costs."

I'll be honest I don't understand how these particular images are generated, though from the broad variety of lighting and angle setups in the examples, it seems plausible that you might be able to generate the same face in different angles and lighting to provide sufficient images to train deepfake encoder."

When someone buys you gold or platinum, you also receive Reddit coins that can be used to gild other users. Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much.

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail. 

We shook hands and said we need to catch up more often. I told him to tell everyone in the old gang that I turned out alright.

Right now, assuming these are uniquely generated (and not stored server-side), I could just take one and use it for anything. Well, legally I can't, but practically I could.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

When someone buys you gold or platinum, you also receive Reddit coins that can be used to gild other users. Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

When someone buys you gold or platinum, you also receive Reddit coins that can be used to gild other users. Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

Edit: Thank you for the gold and silver, folks. ;)"

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts.

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail.

Gradually increase resolution as the routine learns then generate new (fake) images based on the common elements.

Right now, assuming these are uniquely generated (and not stored server-side), I could just take one and use it for anything. Well, legally I can't, but practically I could.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much.

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail.

Gradually increase resolution as the routine learns then generate new (fake) images based on the common elements.

Right now, assuming these are uniquely generated (and not stored server-side), I could just take one and use it for anything. Well, legally I can't, but practically I could.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

When someone buys you gold or platinum, you also receive Reddit coins that can be used to gild other users. Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much. Baseball, science class, the asshole old people who always yelled at us for cutting through their yard, etc. 

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail. 

We shook hands and said we need to catch up more often. I told him to tell everyone in the old gang that I turned out alright.

Right now, assuming these are uniquely generated (and not stored server-side), I could just take one and use it for anything. Well, legally I can't, but practically I could.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

When someone buys you gold or platinum, you also receive Reddit coins that can be used to gild other users. Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

Edit: Thank you for the gold and silver, folks. ;)"

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

When someone buys you gold or platinum, you also receive Reddit coins that can be used to gild other users. Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

Edit: Thank you for the gold and silver, folks. ;)"

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical.

Right now, assuming these are uniquely generated (and not stored server-side), I could just take one and use it for anything. Well, legally I can't, but practically I could.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much. Baseball, science class, the asshole old people who always yelled at us for cutting through their yard, etc. 

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail. 

We shook hands and said we need to catch up more often. I told him to tell everyone in the old gang that I turned out alright.

Gradually increase resolution as the routine learns then generate new (fake) images based on the common elements.

Right now, assuming these are uniquely generated (and not stored server-side), I could just take one and use it for anything. Well, legally I can't, but practically I could.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much. Baseball, science class, the asshole old people who always yelled at us for cutting through their yard, etc. 

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail. 

We shook hands and said we need to catch up more often. I told him to tell everyone in the old gang that I turned out alright.

Right now, assuming these are uniquely generated (and not stored server-side), I could just take one and use it for anything. Well, legally I can't, but practically I could.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

When someone buys you gold or platinum, you also receive Reddit coins that can be used to gild other users. Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

When someone buys you gold or platinum, you also receive Reddit coins that can be used to gild other users. Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

Edit: Thank you for the gold and silver, folks. ;)"

Right now, assuming these are uniquely generated (and not stored server-side), I could just take one and use it for anything. Well, legally I can't, but practically I could.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

He fed me all of the information that I needed to keep the charade going. Id act like I forgot someones name and he would blurt it out as I tried to remember. We talked for hours about so much. Baseball, science class, the asshole old people who always yelled at us for cutting through their yard, etc. 

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail. 

We shook hands and said we need to catch up more often. I told him to tell everyone in the old gang that I turned out alright.

Gradually increase resolution as the routine learns then generate new (fake) images based on the common elements.

Right now, assuming these are uniquely generated (and not stored server-side), I could just take one and use it for anything. Well, legally I can't, but practically I could.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.

Those coins cannot be converted back to cash, so the only way to use them is to show your appreciation for another comment or post by gilding.

So sure, sometimes someone has wasted real money on gilding you, but much of the time, theres no ethical, economic concern, as users are sitting on coins they did not and would not have purchased, and are simply showing kindness and appreciation for your thoughts. Some graciousness would be a much more appropriate response.

He bought me a couple beers and everything was going swimmingly for me until his older brother arrived. The guy called his brother over and introduced me and asked if he remembered me, bro did not. Bro ends up walking away and just ends up eyeballing me from across the bar, I feel like he knew or was at least highly skeptical. It made me uncomfortable and I decided I had enough and told the other guy that I had to hit the old dusty trail.

Start with a low resolution image to determine what elements (pixels) are common among all faces. Gradually increase resolution as the routine learns then generate new (fake) images based on the common elements.

Right now, assuming these are uniquely generated (and not stored server-side), I could just take one and use it for anything. Well, legally I can't, but practically I could.

Although, legally, maybe I could? No _person_ created the images. The monkey who took a selfie had no rights, nor the camera's owner. GPL, etc., always state that output isn't protected. I might argue that **I'm** the creator of the images by virtue of visiting that domain, just as I'm the creator of other images by simply hitting the shutter release on a camera.

I don't plan to do anything with these images; I'm just provoking discussion and making the real suggestion that some link to a license is probably a good idea.
