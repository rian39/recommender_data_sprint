If we accept the erroneous premise of these comments that Chicago is giving up nuclear energy to move to wind and solar then we can see that even if those two latter sources had the ability to supply the city (and they don't), the city would still increase its greenhouse gas emissions.  But because wind and solar are subject to intermittent failures the city will be buying energy from much more carbon intensive sources.  Chicago's emissions will go up thanks to this decision."

It is beyond question that coal and gas plants are far more harmful than nuclear power. Solar and wind power \*may\* be able to eventually take over our power needs, but nuclear is here now, ready to reduce our carbon footprint to almost nothing for a fraction of the cost it will take to do so with solar and wind.

Modern nuclear plants physically cannot fail in the same magnitude as those three events mentioned.

Go ahead and demonize nuclear power if you want to. Just please don't pretend you care at all about the environment while you do so.

Nuclear is expensive to start, that's why you plan for decades ahead. If there's a potential next generation design program in place, why would you build new plants with old tech?

Coupled that with rising public concern and drastically decreasing wind/solar energy, it's obvious what the plan is all about. Relying on currently cheap renewable sources and appeasing public sentiment, while waiting for a newer nuclear solution."
"110",76,"SerHodorTheThrall",5,5,74,1,0,"You're **completely** ignoring a lot of context. 

Most reactor programs were done *en masse*. Its like saying ""highway systems are dumb, look at how prohibitively expensive they are!"". Well yes, that's why we often build them and other infrastructure in a single go. When the government subsidizes or builds, economies of scale don't just go out the window.

Also, France's issue is that they *built too many*. They expected the population to continue to expand with the baby boom (and by extent, demand) but its slowed considerably so there isn't nearly that much demand. 

On top of that, I read that one of the supplies basically shortchanged the program and provided faulty resources (steel or concrete I think) and they're taking safety precautions, so its required temporary shutdowns.

The issue with nuclear is that there needs to be serious oversight and transparency (where it doesn't create safety risks)."

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a yon of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster).

"221",156,"kd8azz",6,6,155,1,0,"(Yes, I know carbon-neutral and renewable are different things, but saying it this way gives me four bullets instead of three.)  I can think of four different definitions of carbon-neutral, when it comes to an electrical grid.

* I buy a kWh worth of carbon offsets for every kWh of electricity I use.
* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.
* Bullet #2, and the carbon-neutral electricity I'm buying is also the geographically closest electricity source, to me, so I'm probably actually using it.
* There are literally zero carbon-burning electricity sources on my grid.


&gt; This is totally impossible without disconnecting from the power grid entirely.

This argues for bullet #4, which is indeed the best.  But I'd argue bullet #3 is probably sufficient.

&gt; How do you think power is being delivered when the sun isnt shining and the wind isnt blowing?

Hopefully storage.  But you're probably right and we're probably back to bullet #2, which is unfortunate.

My house runs on bullet #2.  Bullet #3 can happen with variable pricing and a battery.  If variable pricing was available in my area, I'd buy a battery."
"222",157,"wolfkeeper",6,6,156,1,0,"If I've understood you correctly, there's another carbon neutral system, where there's (say) solar connected on the grid, and it's owned by a producer, who is being paid by customers, who take their electricity from the grid and get metered in the completely normal way.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on."
"223",158,"gymkhana86",6,6,156,1,0,"So, your house runs on a ""kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else"", but in reality, it is really produced by a fossil-fuel power plant... seems like you're being scammed.

Storage is the ideal goal, but we are lightyears away from being able to store that much power...

The power company will charge you a premium for providing you with ""renewable energy"" while in reality, your power still comes from the same sources it did before... It's a business tactic...

"227",162,"neuro-grey7",6,6,155,1,0,"If the city manages to produce more than it uses per year, does it really matter that it's still connected to the grid? That surplus of power gets exported to other locations but regardless, it's still renewable power. Even though as you say, you have no control over where the power comes from, so in theory the city could be using non renewable power, why would that matter? The end goal is 100% renewable power for the US and if the city produces more renewable power than the city uses, isn't that the point? It's a case of the US being a sum of it's parts and getting enough cities to adopt the policy to produce enough for all of the US so Chicago would just be the first step and one part of the whole. I think you're speaking about semantics and what we define as 100% renewable power for a city which isn't the point."
"228",163,"gription",6,6,155,1,0,"You are wrong. Buy the generators and self schedule against your load. This works even in a market. Most of the market is self scheduled anyway. It's not easy, it's not cheap, but it is financially and physically feasible. Just make sure your purchased generation absolutely matches load. How do you deal with no sun or no wind? You buy more of the generation somewhere else in the network and schedule the flows. Like I said, it's not cheap, but it's doable. "

One word: batteries 

Seriously though, in addition to being pedantic (as generally for the sake of discussion people are referring to net use) you're wrong as there are a variety of ways to run your system grid tied if designed properly and not cause any net increase in non-renewable energy use (avoiding peakers etc)."
"230",165,"gymkhana86",6,6,164,1,0,"Really? 

This is nothing more than a business tactic that the power companies use to make you ""feel good"" about where your power comes from. You have ZERO control over where your power comes from. ZERO. If you think that paying extra for ""green, renewable energy"" gets you anything different then before, then you are naive beyond measure...

Batteries cannot make up for the amount of power required on the grid. Renewables aren't even keeping up with the increase in power demand from year to year. Storage is a big problem to be solved. 

If people are talking about net use, then consider then whole country as net use, not just a single community. Of course a single community could generate more than they use in terms of renewable energy, but overall, the total electrical production from renewables is barely a fraction of the total energy required to power a city.

What is your experience with the energy industry? Since you seem to have such a greater understanding of the energy industry than I do?

Modern nuclear plants physically cannot fail in the same magnitude as those three events mentioned.

Also, France's issue is that they *built too many*. They expected the population to continue to expand with the baby boom (and by extent, demand) but its slowed considerably so there isn't nearly that much demand. 

On top of that, I read that one of the supplies basically shortchanged the program and provided faulty resources (steel or concrete I think) and they're taking safety precautions, so its required temporary shutdowns.

That's nuclear.

The problem you think nuclear has, particularly, high construction costs, is because of slow expansion and strict protocols; half assed commitment leads to slow construction, leads to cost overruns, leads to loss of experience, and all in all ultimately leads to using old technology in ""new"" plants.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a yon of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

Absolutely false. We can reprocess nuclear waste into more fuel. We can continue reprocessing until the ""Waste"" (which isn't really waste) is literally gone. More inert than a common rock.

We dont do this because now of some 1960's fears of nuclear proliferation. The level of reprocessing for fuel is much lower than what is needed for weapons though. The technology already exists, and some companies do it for various purposes under a very watchful eye.

&gt; 2. A catastrophic failure has greater environmental consequences.

Again, absolutely false. Not a single nuclear accident has caused environmental damage. Even Chernobyl has 1) had people living on it since the day of the disaster. Google it. Time has an article on them.

2) Flora and Fauna in the Chernobyl exclusion zone are *exploding* compared to their else-located counterparts. Studies are ongoing to see if its something to do woth the accident, or just the absence of humans.

This isn't actually an issue. I know that it sounds like it is, because nuclear is a scary word and the anti-nuclear movement has been so insanely successful with their propaganda. Do your own research on nuclear disasters, find out how many power stations there are and how little they've done.

This is where the politics and the business side of things intertwine. You have to understand that without removing yourself from the grid, you have NO CONTROL over where your power comes from. So, if your power company is charging you extra for ""green energy"" you should understand that it really isn't coming from renewable sources, but from a conglomeration of sources: coal, natural gas, biomass, and renewables, etc. They just ""buy"" credits from ""green"" power sources to offset the amount of power they are providing to their consumers.

* I buy a kWh worth of carbon offsets for every kWh of electricity I use.
* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.
* Bullet #2, and the carbon-neutral electricity I'm buying is also the geographically closest electricity source, to me, so I'm probably actually using it.
* There are literally zero carbon-burning electricity sources on my grid.


&gt; This is totally impossible without disconnecting from the power grid entirely.

This argues for bullet #4, which is indeed the best.  But I'd argue bullet #3 is probably sufficient.

&gt; How do you think power is being delivered when the sun isnt shining and the wind isnt blowing?

Hopefully storage.  But you're probably right and we're probably back to bullet #2, which is unfortunate.

My house runs on bullet #2.  Bullet #3 can happen with variable pricing and a battery.  If variable pricing was available in my area, I'd buy a battery."
"483",160,"wolfkeeper",7,6,159,1,0,"If I've understood you correctly, there's another carbon neutral system, where there's (say) solar connected on the grid, and it's owned by a producer, who is being paid by customers, who take their electricity from the grid and get metered in the completely normal way.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

Batteries cannot make up for the amount of power required on the grid. Renewables aren't even keeping up with the increase in power demand from year to year. Storage is a big problem to be solved. 

If people are talking about net use, then consider then whole country as net use, not just a single community. Of course a single community could generate more than they use in terms of renewable energy, but overall, the total electrical production from renewables is barely a fraction of the total energy required to power a city.

Also, France's issue is that they *built too many*. They expected the population to continue to expand with the baby boom (and by extent, demand) but its slowed considerably so there isn't nearly that much demand. 

On top of that, I read that one of the supplies basically shortchanged the program and provided faulty resources (steel or concrete I think) and they're taking safety precautions, so its required temporary shutdowns.

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

That's nuclear. 

What's more, if you believe nuclear is redundant and outdated, that means you know something that physicists all over the world for decades now don't. Because they've been researching, redoubling their efforts recently, into researching nuclear *fusion*. 

The problem you think nuclear has, particularly, high construction costs, is because of slow expansion and strict protocols; half assed commitment leads to slow construction, leads to cost overruns, leads to loss of experience, and all in all ultimately leads to using old technology in ""new"" plants.

There are so many redundant systems in place to prevent catastrophic failure, that even in our simulators that we train on, they have a hard time actually causing any kind of release to the environment. Reactor operators are trained for two years before they are even given the chance to take the test to get their license. And that license is given by the NRC, not the company.

Chernobyl had a positive temperature reactivity coefficient, which means as the temperature goes up (like in a meltdown), reactivity goes up. So the hotter it gets, the faster it gets hot. American reactors have negative coefficients, which means if they get too hot, they shut down automatically. The fuel itself will remain hot, but it won't be like Chernobyl. 

There actually was a catastrophic failure and partial meltdown in an American power plant at 3 mile island. There were no deaths and no injuries, and that plant was in the middle of Philadelphia. It's still operating. The safety features worked well.

Edit: it's not near Philly. It's 10 miles outside Harrisburg. My bad. It is, however right near houses and not out in the middle of a desert somewhere.

I don't think there is any data to prove (or disprove for that matter) that statement. Solar at least has a fairly large environmental impact over time.

I'm just talking out of my ass, but my intuition says solar energy has a fairly large environmental impact that people are ignoring because it's is something other than literally burning shit. "

We also produce a tiny amount of waste, essentially an Olympic swimming pool of waste every year which is nothing compared to other sources of energy. Also, were developing new reactors that can use this nuclear waste. 


2. The reactors we have today are safer than Chernobyl by a factor of ten or more, reactors that we can build right now are safer by a factor of 100. Reactors under development will even be unable to undergo meltdown. Furthermore, a catastrophic meltdown isnt as bad as you think. Fukushima and Chernobyl are the only examples of a true catastrophic failure. 64 people have died to Chernobyl while none have died in Fukushima (the fearmongering and panic has killed more people there than actual radiation). Compare that to coal which kills thousands in the US annually or to solar power which kills 16x more people than nuclear per Gigawatt produced. "

&gt;2 parts to consider about nuclear power, 
&gt;1. nuclear waste that we still can't decompose or repurpose(or apparently permanently store)

Absolutely false. We can reprocess nuclear waste into more fuel. We can continue reprocessing until the ""Waste"" (which isn't really waste) is literally gone. More inert than a common rock.

We dont do this because now of some 1960's fears of nuclear proliferation. The level of reprocessing for fuel is much lower than what is needed for weapons though. The technology already exists, and some companies do it for various purposes under a very watchful eye.

&gt; 2. A catastrophic failure has greater environmental consequences.

Again, absolutely false. Not a single nuclear accident has caused environmental damage. Even Chernobyl has 1) had people living on it since the day of the disaster. Google it. Time has an article on them.

2) Flora and Fauna in the Chernobyl exclusion zone are *exploding* compared to their else-located counterparts. Studies are ongoing to see if its something to do woth the accident, or just the absence of humans.

&gt;However, the short term is better for the environment, and is potentially mobile with some advancement in tech.  Its also safer in when you compare failure rates of coal plants to nuclear plants, for obvious reasons.

Short term, long term, and until we get fusion power working. We need nuclear *right now*. We could solve the energy side of climate change in 5 years if we put the money where our mouths were and got over this ridiculous misinformation campaign, which you are (unwittingly?) part of.

Nuclear is also safer than all renewables, even when compared to each individually. Its also cleaner to produce than solar panels, wind turbines, and especially batteries needed to go along with those."

OK, easy fix, don't be incompetent morons like the Soviets were at Chernobyl and don't build nuclear power plants on active faults next to the coast. Every other nuclear power incident in history has been blown out of proportion without actually causing deaths or more radiation to be released then what you'd get from an x-ray.   


This isn't actually an issue. I know that it sounds like it is, because nuclear is a scary word and the anti-nuclear movement has been so insanely successful with their propaganda. Do your own research on nuclear disasters, find out how many power stations there are and how little they've done. Then look at their emission costs even relative to solar and wind (over the entire industry, nuclear creates most of its emissions via uranium mining---which is far less than the impact of mining and creation of solar panels/wind turbines and especially the batteries we'd need to actually run a stable grid with those.)

And Fukushima was 40 year old badly maintained technology with a flawed plant design (underground backup power on a coastal site on a fault line = facepalm) and a foreseeable natural disaster.

One of the biggest problems with nuclear power is the fact that we're not building more, which means obsolete designs are staying in service longer than they should. "

"764",523,"caesarfecit",8,8,521,1,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"765",524,"LLJKTympanic",8,8,521,1,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

"775",530,"GlowingGreenie",8,8,529,1,0,"&gt;mostly that hastelloy isnt rated for long-term radiation exposure

Hastelloy is required for fluoride reactors, but of course not all fluid fueled reactors use fluoride.  Chloride reactors are being pursued and the corrosion is easier to manage. IINM stainless steel is an NRC accepted material for handling chlorinated actinides.

&gt;the chemistry for reprocessing the fissile salts being bred from thorium isnt mature, i think

Again, that is a specific design aspect of the liquid fluoride thorium reactor, but not all molten salt reactors use fluoride salts, or require chemical processing systems to filter uranium out of the blanket salt.  A chloride fast reactor, for example, can breed and consume thorium in-situ while not requiring chemical processing of the salt to isolate actinides.  Instead fission products are drawn off, leaving the fissile and fertile materials to burn up.

&gt;thorium is definitely the easiest path to making more energy than we can possibly use, but its not ready. yet.

I'm fuel and reactor agnostic, but for the moment I'd argue spent nuclear fuel, weapons/reactor grade plutonium, and depleted/natural uranium present an easier path to using nuclear energy in the next decade.  A chloride fast reactor can be all the things promised by the LFTR while eliminating lithium enrichment, graphite moderators in the core, and enabling the burnup of long lived transuranic elements.  And IMHO the ten years required to develop and deploy LFTRs, MCFRs, IMSRs, SSRs, and other variations on the molten salt reactor is likely to still be much less than is required for electrical storage to displace fossil fuels.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a yon of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.

Hopefully storage.  But you're probably right and we're probably back to bullet #2, which is unfortunate.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries cannot make up for the amount of power required on the grid. Renewables aren't even keeping up with the increase in power demand from year to year. Storage is a big problem to be solved. 

If people are talking about net use, then consider then whole country as net use, not just a single community.

Modern nuclear plants physically cannot fail in the same magnitude as those three events mentioned.

Also, France's issue is that they *built too many*. They expected the population to continue to expand with the baby boom (and by extent, demand) but its slowed considerably so there isn't nearly that much demand. 

On top of that, I read that one of the supplies basically shortchanged the program and provided faulty resources (steel or concrete I think) and they're taking safety precautions, so its required temporary shutdowns.

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "

"930",637,"filbert227",8,8,635,1,0,"The problem is baseload is a lot more complex than just sending power from one region to another.  The grid may be connected across a pretty large distance but power isn't really sent that far in comparison to the three u.s. grids sizes.  Sending the energy from Arizona where the sun is intense all the way up to Colorado because it's overcast is incredibly inefficient.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I almost forgot...  I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.

No need for battery, storage solutions. It can be built and applied anywhere, in land or in sea, requires low input, with practically zero emission.

That's nuclear. 

What's more, if you believe nuclear is redundant and outdated, that means you know something that physicists all over the world for decades now don't. Because they've been researching, redoubling their efforts recently, into researching nuclear *fusion*. 

The problem you think nuclear has, particularly, high construction costs, is because of slow expansion and strict protocols; half assed commitment leads to slow construction, leads to cost overruns, leads to loss of experience, and all in all ultimately leads to using old technology in ""new"" plants. If we adopt nuclear fully and rapidly, the construction costs and time would be a lot lower, because of economy of scale and experience gained from having no gaps between building different projects.

I am an environmental scientist with an energy focus. This is my core expertise.

The plants are still in operation and still bringing in revenue, just not quite as much as they had previously.

&gt;environmental scientist with an energy focus

Just saying that does not inspire confidence. I have spoken to one such fellow who did not know what [capacity factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor) was. He kept confounding it with [Betz's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27s_law) (trying to explain to me why CF is so low for wind). 

Once you use historical wind/solar data to plan for an entire country grid using just wind/solar, then one usually starts seeing some pretty large ""overcapacity"" and storage requirements.

To supply 10GW of electricty you usually need 40GW of wind (average capacity factor of 25% ([France](https://community.ieawind.org/about/member-activities/france))). You also need very large storage for those days that the wind does not blow at all. Which can be for [up to a week](http://euanmearns.com/wind-blowing-nowhere/).

Not the paltry four hours of the current battery systems. Or is the solar/wind going to be backstopped by gas?
"
"945",652,"JuckFeebus",8,8,651,1,0,"You raise good points, but (no offense) obviously nothing that folks in my field don't spend a lot of time analyzing.

The bottom line is that batteries are fine to get us to about 90% solar and wind pretty much everywhere that any significant number of people live, and the rest we need from some combination of other renewables (hydro, geothermal, tidal, etc) and nuclear power. Any more than 90%, and the long stretches of cloudy winter days make the battery requirements multiply. Up to around 90%, we can get away with less than 24 hours of battery backup power - some analyses suggest as little as 12 hours.

Even if you run the numbers for 24 hours of battery storage, solar with 3x overcapacity still comes out as less expensive than nuclear power after 2025 or so. Up to then we don't really run into overcapacity or battery constraints anyway, since we're picking off the low hanging fruit.

Nobody is arguing that the small amount of installed capacity of renewables we already have is having a major impact on CO2 emissions today. That's absurd. 

The relevant claim is that replacing a substantial portion of the energy mix with renewables would reduce emissions, which it obviously and incontrovertibly would.

But your original post made the nonsensical claim that renewables will actually increase emissions in the future:

&gt; This is how we slide our way into global warming

&gt; The carbon dioxide inevitably produced by coal plants and CCGTs when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine doesn't go away.

That is completely incoherent. Coal and gas will be used to produce power that renewables don't produce, just as they will be used to produce power that nuclear plants don't produce. The solution to emissions from coal and gas is ... to replace them...

Now maybe you're trying to make some screwy sideways point about intermittancy being an issue, but of course it isn't because large scale stationary energy storage is now cost-effective - as the recent success in Australia showed last year, which motivated PG&amp;E in California to buy the equivalent of 17 of the Australian Hornsdale Power Reserve batteries. And as for coal and gas, that one battery decimated 55% of the gas peaking power plant market in South Australia overnight when it went operational.

Again, none of this is controversial or even questioned among investors and experts in the energy sector. It's why Toshiba and Hitachi and Exelon are all exiting the nuclear power industry.

We've spent far more on those renewables than we did on nuclear energy.  It seems only right we expect the same return on the money we flushed down that hole.

&gt;The relevant claim is that replacing a substantial portion of the energy mix with renewables would reduce emissions, which it obviously and incontrovertibly would.

Germany claims to generate 37% of their energy from renewable sources, yet their carbon emissions have remained fixed.  Is 37% not 'substantial'?

&gt;Coal and gas will be used to produce power that renewables don't produce, just as they will be used to produce power that nuclear plants don't produce. 

Nuclear reactors have far greater up time and capacity factors than wind and solar.  Their downtimes are programmed and scheduled such that other reactors can pick up the slack for one unit being taken offline for maintenance.  That greatly reduces the carbon emissions from the units being offline.

&gt;And as for coal and gas, that one battery decimated 55% of the gas peaking power plant market in South Australia overnight when it went operational.

Again, this is so extraordinarily incorrect as that is most definitely not what happened.  The battery did not reduce the use of gas, only the ability of the company providing it to charge a premium for responding to second-to-second changes in frequency caused by intermittent renewables.  The batteries in question have zero capability to supply the grid as a whole for more than a few minutes, but can absorb and feed power to the grid such that they reduce the impact of renewables' intermittency on the grid.  This is absolutely the right role for batteries on the grid, but it's orders of magnitude short of what is required for day-to-day operations on a 100% renewable grid and it's patently dishonest to pretend otherwise."

There are so many redundant systems in place to prevent catastrophic failure, that even in our simulators that we train on, they have a hard time actually causing any kind of release to the environment. Reactor operators are trained for two years before they are even given the chance to take the test to get their license. And that license is given by the NRC, not the company. And then they are retested annually. 

There is no safer, cleaner energy than nuclear. The lifetime carbon footprint of wind is larger than nuclear per MW. Solar energy requires batteries which also require special disposition and handling, much like spent fuel from a reactor.

"1122",756,"ServetusM",9,9,754,1,0,"Except literally every point he made about it was wrong. First, we can repurpose it, and/or force it to decompose. There are special reactors which can turn nuclear waste inert (Or make it slightly less dangerous than natural radioactive material you'd find in the ground--which makes it simple to store.) 

You can also use those special reactors to create energy. Or you can ""recharge"" the waste and use it in the same reactor that created it. France actually revitalizes a portion of its waste to use as fuel (And this process slowly degrades the waste, making it less and less radioactive.) 

Now, people may wonder why we don't do these things. The answer is? Its cheaper just to store and dig up more. Part of the reason for that is the enormous amount of red tape surrounding everything nuclear. Even moving the stuff costs a ton of money due to the security restrictions. (The military actually requires less security around its nuclear projects than the civilian sector is required to have.) In addition, its extremely hard to build new facilities due to this same red tape, especially specialty facilities.

This creates a kind of self fulfilling prophecy, too. Because it forces us to rely on older reactors--which are less safe. Fukishima for example--we predicted and solved the problem in Fukishima decades ago. U.S. reactors, under the same conditions, would not have had an accident. But because of the red tape? Well...(It's like if the government prevented new cars from being built to ""keep the roads safe"", and forced everyone to drive cars from the 60's--and because those designs are far less safe, more people die, so the government imposes more restrictions, ensuring cars from the 60's remain in use forever.)"
"1123",300,"PaxNova",9,7,298,21,0,"Please pardon pjay's abrasive manner of speech, but he is right about the facts.

Chernobyl had a positive temperature reactivity coefficient, which means as the temperature goes up (like in a meltdown), reactivity goes up. So the hotter it gets, the faster it gets hot. American reactors have negative coefficients, which means if they get too hot, they shut down automatically. The fuel itself will remain hot, but it won't be like Chernobyl. 

There actually was a catastrophic failure and partial meltdown in an American power plant at 3 mile island. There were no deaths and no injuries, and that plant was in the middle of Philadelphia. It's still operating. The safety features worked well.

Edit: it's not near Philly. It's 10 miles outside Harrisburg. My bad. It is, however right near houses and not out in the middle of a desert somewhere.

I don't think there is any data to prove (or disprove for that matter) that statement. Solar at least has a fairly large environmental impact over time.

&gt;2 parts to consider about nuclear power, 
&gt;1. nuclear waste that we still can't decompose or repurpose(or apparently permanently store)

Absolutely false. We can reprocess nuclear waste into more fuel. We can continue reprocessing until the ""Waste"" (which isn't really waste) is literally gone. More inert than a common rock.

We dont do this because now of some 1960's fears of nuclear proliferation. The level of reprocessing for fuel is much lower than what is needed for weapons though. The technology already exists, and some companies do it for various purposes under a very watchful eye.

&gt; 2. A catastrophic failure has greater environmental consequences.

Again, absolutely false. Not a single nuclear accident has caused environmental damage. Even Chernobyl has 1) had people living on it since the day of the disaster. Google it. Time has an article on them.

2) Flora and Fauna in the Chernobyl exclusion zone are *exploding* compared to their else-located counterparts. Studies are ongoing to see if its something to do woth the accident, or just the absence of humans.

&gt;However, the short term is better for the environment, and is potentially mobile with some advancement in tech.  Its also safer in when you compare failure rates of coal plants to nuclear plants, for obvious reasons.

Short term, long term, and until we get fusion power working. We need nuclear *right now*. We could solve the energy side of climate change in 5 years if we put the money where our mouths were and got over this ridiculous misinformation campaign, which you are (unwittingly?) part of.

Nuclear is also safer than all renewables, even when compared to each individually. Its also cleaner to produce than solar panels, wind turbines, and especially batteries needed to go along with those."
"1134",765,"austrianemperor",9,9,298,6,0,"1. We can permanently store it, we built a storage complex at Yucca mountain, but weve let anti-nuclear fear mongers influence the Native Americans there into shutting it down. We also produce a tiny amount of waste, essentially an Olympic swimming pool of waste every year which is nothing compared to other sources of energy. Also, were developing new reactors that can use this nuclear waste. 


2. The reactors we have today are safer than Chernobyl by a factor of ten or more, reactors that we can build right now are safer by a factor of 100. Reactors under development will even be unable to undergo meltdown. Furthermore, a catastrophic meltdown isnt as bad as you think. Fukushima and Chernobyl are the only examples of a true catastrophic failure. 64 people have died to Chernobyl while none have died in Fukushima (the fearmongering and panic has killed more people there than actual radiation). Compare that to coal which kills thousands in the US annually or to solar power which kills 16x more people than nuclear per Gigawatt produced. "

OK, easy fix, don't be incompetent morons like the Soviets were at Chernobyl and don't build nuclear power plants on active faults next to the coast. Every other nuclear power incident in history has been blown out of proportion without actually causing deaths or more radiation to be released then what you'd get from an x-ray.   


This isn't actually an issue. I know that it sounds like it is, because nuclear is a scary word and the anti-nuclear movement has been so insanely successful with their propaganda. Do your own research on nuclear disasters, find out how many power stations there are and how little they've done. Then look at their emission costs even relative to solar and wind (over the entire industry, nuclear creates most of its emissions via uranium mining---which is far less than the impact of mining and creation of solar panels/wind turbines and especially the batteries we'd need to actually run a stable grid with those.)

Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."

And Fukushima was 40 year old badly maintained technology with a flawed plant design (underground backup power on a coastal site on a fault line = facepalm) and a foreseeable natural disaster.

"1189",803,"caesarfecit",9,9,526,1,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"1190",804,"LLJKTympanic",9,9,526,1,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

"1200",812,"GlowingGreenie",9,9,811,1,0,"&gt;mostly that hastelloy isnt rated for long-term radiation exposure

Hastelloy is required for fluoride reactors, but of course not all fluid fueled reactors use fluoride.  Chloride reactors are being pursued and the corrosion is easier to manage. IINM stainless steel is an NRC accepted material for handling chlorinated actinides.

&gt;the chemistry for reprocessing the fissile salts being bred from thorium isnt mature, i think

Again, that is a specific design aspect of the liquid fluoride thorium reactor, but not all molten salt reactors use fluoride salts, or require chemical processing systems to filter uranium out of the blanket salt.  A chloride fast reactor, for example, can breed and consume thorium in-situ while not requiring chemical processing of the salt to isolate actinides.  Instead fission products are drawn off, leaving the fissile and fertile materials to burn up.

&gt;thorium is definitely the easiest path to making more energy than we can possibly use, but its not ready. yet.

I'm fuel and reactor agnostic, but for the moment I'd argue spent nuclear fuel, weapons/reactor grade plutonium, and depleted/natural uranium present an easier path to using nuclear energy in the next decade.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a yon of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

In the long run, I would love to see the world switch to 100% renewable energy, but in the short-term, the corporations that are charging you for energy, are doing so at an increased rate due to the illusion that they are providing you with ""green energy"". This is where the politics and the business side of things intertwine. You have to understand that without removing yourself from the grid, you have NO CONTROL over where your power comes from. So, if your power company is charging you extra for ""green energy"" you should understand that it really isn't coming from renewable sources, but from a conglomeration of sources: coal, natural gas, biomass, and renewables, etc. They just ""buy"" credits from ""green"" power sources to offset the amount of power they are providing to their consumers. It's a big scam. They can even buy green credits from investments into their future ""green energy"" sources..."
"1293",578,"kd8azz",9,8,575,5,0,"(Yes, I know carbon-neutral and renewable are different things, but saying it this way gives me four bullets instead of three.)  I can think of four different definitions of carbon-neutral, when it comes to an electrical grid.

* I buy a kWh worth of carbon offsets for every kWh of electricity I use.
* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.
* Bullet #2, and the carbon-neutral electricity I'm buying is also the geographically closest electricity source, to me, so I'm probably actually using it.
* There are literally zero carbon-burning electricity sources on my grid.


&gt; This is totally impossible without disconnecting from the power grid entirely.

This argues for bullet #4, which is indeed the best.  But I'd argue bullet #3 is probably sufficient.

&gt; How do you think power is being delivered when the sun isnt shining and the wind isnt blowing?

Hopefully storage.  But you're probably right and we're probably back to bullet #2, which is unfortunate.

My house runs on bullet #2.  Bullet #3 can happen with variable pricing and a battery.  If variable pricing was available in my area, I'd buy a battery."
"1294",579,"wolfkeeper",9,8,578,3,0,"If I've understood you correctly, there's another carbon neutral system, where there's (say) solar connected on the grid, and it's owned by a producer, who is being paid by customers, who take their electricity from the grid and get metered in the completely normal way.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

Storage is the ideal goal, but we are lightyears away from being able to store that much power...

Batteries cannot make up for the amount of power required on the grid. Renewables aren't even keeping up with the increase in power demand from year to year. Storage is a big problem to be solved. 

If people are talking about net use, then consider then whole country as net use, not just a single community. Of course a single community could generate more than they use in terms of renewable energy, but overall, the total electrical production from renewables is barely a fraction of the total energy required to power a city.

Also, France's issue is that they *built too many*. They expected the population to continue to expand with the baby boom (and by extent, demand) but its slowed considerably so there isn't nearly that much demand. 

On top of that, I read that one of the supplies basically shortchanged the program and provided faulty resources (steel or concrete I think) and they're taking safety precautions, so its required temporary shutdowns.

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

The grid may be connected across a pretty large distance but power isn't really sent that far in comparison to the three u.s. grids sizes.  Sending the energy from Arizona where the sun is intense all the way up to Colorado because it's overcast is incredibly inefficient.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I almost forgot...  I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.

What if I told you there's an even better alternative than solar, geothermal, wave, tidal and wind? This technology does not rely on surrounding environmental context. No need for battery, storage solutions. It can be built and applied anywhere, in land or in sea, requires low input, with practically zero emission.

That's nuclear. 

What's more, if you believe nuclear is redundant and outdated, that means you know something that physicists all over the world for decades now don't. Because they've been researching, redoubling their efforts recently, into researching nuclear *fusion*. 

The problem you think nuclear has, particularly, high construction costs, is because of slow expansion and strict protocols; half assed commitment leads to slow construction, leads to cost overruns, leads to loss of experience, and all in all ultimately leads to using old technology in ""new"" plants. If we adopt nuclear fully and rapidly, the construction costs and time would be a lot lower, because of economy of scale and experience gained from having no gaps between building different projects.

I am an environmental scientist with an energy focus. This is my core expertise.

It's a total no-brainer if you have any actual knowledge about the numbers at all. And folks in the industry know it obviously, which is why investment in nuclear power has dried up to nothing, entire countries (Germany, UK, Spain, etc) have planned to get off nuclear power entirely, and all the investment is now going to solar, wind, and batteries.

The South Australia battery didn't reduce the market share of the peaking plants, it reduced their revenue as they were unable to claim a premium for fast response that they'd previously received.  The plants are still in operation and still bringing in revenue, just not quite as much as they had previously.  FCAS is the perfect application for batteries on the grid, and one that should be expanded, but to try to pretend that a few measily megawatt-hours is going to displace dispatchable power is simply dishonest."

Again, you're stuck in the present.

Judging by your username it's obvious why you're so committed to your position. I don't have a stake in any industry, I'm not one team or the other. Nuclear power would be great if it were cheap, I have nothing against it. But it isn't cheap. It's extremely expensive.

&gt;environmental scientist with an energy focus

Just saying that does not inspire confidence. I have spoken to one such fellow who did not know what [capacity factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor) was. He kept confounding it with [Betz's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27s_law) (trying to explain to me why CF is so low for wind). 

Once you use historical wind/solar data to plan for an entire country grid using just wind/solar, then one usually starts seeing some pretty large ""overcapacity"" and storage requirements.

To supply 10GW of electricty you usually need 40GW of wind (average capacity factor of 25% ([France](https://community.ieawind.org/about/member-activities/france))). You also need very large storage for those days that the wind does not blow at all. Which can be for [up to a week](http://euanmearns.com/wind-blowing-nowhere/).

Not the paltry four hours of the current battery systems. Or is the solar/wind going to be backstopped by gas?
"
"1377",652,"JuckFeebus",9,8,651,1,0,"You raise good points, but (no offense) obviously nothing that folks in my field don't spend a lot of time analyzing.

The bottom line is that batteries are fine to get us to about 90% solar and wind pretty much everywhere that any significant number of people live, and the rest we need from some combination of other renewables (hydro, geothermal, tidal, etc) and nuclear power. Any more than 90%, and the long stretches of cloudy winter days make the battery requirements multiply. Up to around 90%, we can get away with less than 24 hours of battery backup power - some analyses suggest as little as 12 hours.

Even if you run the numbers for 24 hours of battery storage, solar with 3x overcapacity still comes out as less expensive than nuclear power after 2025 or so. Up to then we don't really run into overcapacity or battery constraints anyway, since we're picking off the low hanging fruit.

And I should add that the typical cost analysis is run with asset lifetimes of 25 years, but we know that solar plants will last 40 years or more, so at least 15 years of electricity output is discounted to zero. And solar plus batteries still wins.

Economically, solar and batteries are a slam dunk over investing in nuclear power. And that's why hundreds of billions are going into those solar and batteries, while all the majors like Hitachi and Toshiba and Exelon are pulling out of the nuclear industry."

&gt;Any more than 90%, and the long stretches of cloudy winter days make the battery requirements multiply. Up to around 90%, we can get away with less than 24 hours of battery backup power - some analyses suggest as little as 12 hours.

I think that 90% of the **time** for renewables you only need 24H storage. It is the other 10% that is a killer. This is easily shown using historical wind/solar data. 

I don't believe that it is when renewables are 90% of the **supply**. Since if the renewables go to zero for two, three days, the 10% of coal/nuclear/gas/biomass won't be sufficient to make up for the deficit.

That 10% means that you will have load shedding (planned blackouts) for roughly 30 days a year. Usually when you want electricity the most (miserable cold/dark/wet weather).

That people are using batteries as peaking power supplies isn't a good argument since the cost of the electricity supplied during peak times can easily be ten times as expensive making it economically feasible.

In australia, during their heatwave, it might have been feasible to burn some third world country's bills to supply electricity. Not really, but the cost did increase [30-140 times average price](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-power/heat-wave-leaves-thousands-of-australian-homes-without-power-idUSKBN1FI0CO)."

But this is r/futurology, not r/rightnow.  There are a number of companies developing reactors which are safer, lower cost, more efficient, and even able to consume the waste products from our existing reactor fleet.  At least some of those companies will encounter commercial success before we can reach the point where significant storage can be rolled out at the grid level.

&gt;Itd be less expensive, quicker, and far less labor intensive to build a gigawatt of generation from solar or wind.

But that gigawatt of installed capacity only has a capacity factor of 20 to 30 percent.  You'd have to install a nameplate capacity of upwards of 3 gigawatts to get the same energy out of that renewables installation on a consistent basis.  That would of course bring with it the greater ecological impact that comes with distributed generation.

I think you're massively underestimating the support required to keep solar and wind farms going.  Even residential rooftop solar companies employ tens of thousands of maintenance personnel to deal with customer issues.  Utility-scale plants with moving parts, be they 'turbines' or tracking arrays all require maintenance, as do the extensive distribution networks that must be created to bring the energy to the point where it will be utilized.

But they didn't and the numbers speak for themselves."
"1456",891,"JuckFeebus",9,9,890,1,0,"Your original post made claims about the *future*, not about the present.

Nobody is arguing that the small amount of installed capacity of renewables we already have is having a major impact on CO2 emissions today. That's absurd. 

The relevant claim is that replacing a substantial portion of the energy mix with renewables would reduce emissions, which it obviously and incontrovertibly would.

But your original post made the nonsensical claim that renewables will actually increase emissions in the future:

&gt; This is how we slide our way into global warming

. 
 
&gt; The carbon dioxide inevitably produced by coal plants and CCGTs when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine doesn't go away.

That is completely incoherent. Coal and gas will be used to produce power that renewables don't produce, just as they will be used to produce power that nuclear plants don't produce. The solution to emissions from coal and gas is ... to replace them...

Now maybe you're trying to make some screwy sideways point about intermittancy being an issue, but of course it isn't because large scale stationary energy storage is now cost-effective - as the recent success in Australia showed last year, which motivated PG&amp;E in California to buy the equivalent of 17 of the Australian Hornsdale Power Reserve batteries. And as for coal and gas, that one battery decimated 55% of the gas peaking power plant market in South Australia overnight when it went operational.

Again, none of this is controversial or even questioned among investors and experts in the energy sector. It's why Toshiba and Hitachi and Exelon are all exiting the nuclear power industry. Anyone who wants more details can look at my other posts where I run through all of the relevant figures on cost that have sealed the fate of the nuclear power industry."
"1457",892,"GlowingGreenie",9,9,891,1,0,"&gt; Nobody is arguing that the small amount of installed capacity of renewables we already have is having a major impact on CO2 emissions today. 

We've spent far more on those renewables than we did on nuclear energy.  It seems only right we expect the same return on the money we flushed down that hole.

&gt;The relevant claim is that replacing a substantial portion of the energy mix with renewables would reduce emissions, which it obviously and incontrovertibly would.

Germany claims to generate 37% of their energy from renewable sources, yet their carbon emissions have remained fixed.  Is 37% not 'substantial'?

&gt;Coal and gas will be used to produce power that renewables don't produce, just as they will be used to produce power that nuclear plants don't produce. 

Nuclear reactors have far greater up time and capacity factors than wind and solar.  Their downtimes are programmed and scheduled such that other reactors can pick up the slack for one unit being taken offline for maintenance.  That greatly reduces the carbon emissions from the units being offline.

&gt;And as for coal and gas, that one battery decimated 55% of the gas peaking power plant market in South Australia overnight when it went operational.

Again, this is so extraordinarily incorrect as that is most definitely not what happened.  The battery did not reduce the use of gas, only the ability of the company providing it to charge a premium for responding to second-to-second changes in frequency caused by intermittent renewables.  The batteries in question have zero capability to supply the grid as a whole for more than a few minutes, but can absorb and feed power to the grid such that they reduce the impact of renewables' intermittency on the grid.  This is absolutely the right role for batteries on the grid, but it's orders of magnitude short of what is required for day-to-day operations on a 100% renewable grid and it's patently dishonest to pretend otherwise."

As we get close to 60-70% renewables (the current easy-to-manage limit), decide whether it's worth building current generation nuclear at its overinflated cost or deploy cheaper/better advanced nukes if they're cheap enough.

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition).

Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."

"1592",953,"ServetusM",10,10,951,1,0,"Except literally every point he made about it was wrong. First, we can repurpose it, and/or force it to decompose. There are special reactors which can turn nuclear waste inert (Or make it slightly less dangerous than natural radioactive material you'd find in the ground--which makes it simple to store.) 

You can also use those special reactors to create energy. Or you can ""recharge"" the waste and use it in the same reactor that created it. France actually revitalizes a portion of its waste to use as fuel (And this process slowly degrades the waste, making it less and less radioactive.) 

Now, people may wonder why we don't do these things. The answer is? Its cheaper just to store and dig up more. Part of the reason for that is the enormous amount of red tape surrounding everything nuclear. Even moving the stuff costs a ton of money due to the security restrictions. (The military actually requires less security around its nuclear projects than the civilian sector is required to have.) In addition, its extremely hard to build new facilities due to this same red tape, especially specialty facilities.

This creates a kind of self fulfilling prophecy, too. Because it forces us to rely on older reactors--which are less safe. Fukishima for example--we predicted and solved the problem in Fukishima decades ago. U.S. reactors, under the same conditions, would not have had an accident. But because of the red tape? Well...(It's like if the government prevented new cars from being built to ""keep the roads safe"", and forced everyone to drive cars from the 60's--and because those designs are far less safe, more people die, so the government imposes more restrictions, ensuring cars from the 60's remain in use forever.)"

Chernobyl had a positive temperature reactivity coefficient, which means as the temperature goes up (like in a meltdown), reactivity goes up. So the hotter it gets, the faster it gets hot. American reactors have negative coefficients, which means if they get too hot, they shut down automatically. The fuel itself will remain hot, but it won't be like Chernobyl. 

There actually was a catastrophic failure and partial meltdown in an American power plant at 3 mile island. There were no deaths and no injuries, and that plant was in the middle of Philadelphia. It's still operating. The safety features worked well.

&gt;2 parts to consider about nuclear power, 
&gt;1. nuclear waste that we still can't decompose or repurpose(or apparently permanently store)

Absolutely false. We can reprocess nuclear waste into more fuel. We can continue reprocessing until the ""Waste"" (which isn't really waste) is literally gone. More inert than a common rock.

We dont do this because now of some 1960's fears of nuclear proliferation. The level of reprocessing for fuel is much lower than what is needed for weapons though. The technology already exists, and some companies do it for various purposes under a very watchful eye.

&gt; 2. A catastrophic failure has greater environmental consequences.

Again, absolutely false. Not a single nuclear accident has caused environmental damage. Even Chernobyl has 1) had people living on it since the day of the disaster. Google it. Time has an article on them.

2) Flora and Fauna in the Chernobyl exclusion zone are *exploding* compared to their else-located counterparts. Studies are ongoing to see if its something to do woth the accident, or just the absence of humans.

&gt;However, the short term is better for the environment, and is potentially mobile with some advancement in tech.  Its also safer in when you compare failure rates of coal plants to nuclear plants, for obvious reasons.

Short term, long term, and until we get fusion power working. We need nuclear *right now*. We could solve the energy side of climate change in 5 years if we put the money where our mouths were and got over this ridiculous misinformation campaign, which you are (unwittingly?) part of.

Nuclear is also safer than all renewables, even when compared to each individually. Its also cleaner to produce than solar panels, wind turbines, and especially batteries needed to go along with those."

2. The reactors we have today are safer than Chernobyl by a factor of ten or more, reactors that we can build right now are safer by a factor of 100. Reactors under development will even be unable to undergo meltdown. Furthermore, a catastrophic meltdown isnt as bad as you think. Fukushima and Chernobyl are the only examples of a true catastrophic failure. 64 people have died to Chernobyl while none have died in Fukushima (the fearmongering and panic has killed more people there than actual radiation).

This isn't actually an issue. I know that it sounds like it is, because nuclear is a scary word and the anti-nuclear movement has been so insanely successful with their propaganda. Do your own research on nuclear disasters, find out how many power stations there are and how little they've done.

And Fukushima was 40 year old badly maintained technology with a flawed plant design (underground backup power on a coastal site on a fault line = facepalm) and a foreseeable natural disaster.

"1662",803,"caesarfecit",10,9,526,20,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"1663",804,"LLJKTympanic",10,9,526,16,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

"1674",812,"GlowingGreenie",10,9,811,0,0,"&gt;mostly that hastelloy isnt rated for long-term radiation exposure

Hastelloy is required for fluoride reactors, but of course not all fluid fueled reactors use fluoride.  Chloride reactors are being pursued and the corrosion is easier to manage. IINM stainless steel is an NRC accepted material for handling chlorinated actinides.

&gt;the chemistry for reprocessing the fissile salts being bred from thorium isnt mature, i think

Again, that is a specific design aspect of the liquid fluoride thorium reactor, but not all molten salt reactors use fluoride salts, or require chemical processing systems to filter uranium out of the blanket salt.  A chloride fast reactor, for example, can breed and consume thorium in-situ while not requiring chemical processing of the salt to isolate actinides.  Instead fission products are drawn off, leaving the fissile and fertile materials to burn up.

&gt;thorium is definitely the easiest path to making more energy than we can possibly use, but its not ready. yet.

I'm fuel and reactor agnostic, but for the moment I'd argue spent nuclear fuel, weapons/reactor grade plutonium, and depleted/natural uranium present an easier path to using nuclear energy in the next decade.  A chloride fast reactor can be all the things promised by the LFTR while eliminating lithium enrichment, graphite moderators in the core, and enabling the burnup of long lived transuranic elements.  And IMHO the ten years required to develop and deploy LFTRs, MCFRs, IMSRs, SSRs, and other variations on the molten salt reactor is likely to still be much less than is required for electrical storage to displace fossil fuels.

"1730",1015,"Optix334",10,10,553,21,0,"There is no reason to get rid of nuclear. It's better in pretty much every way, and scalable to smaller applications than renewables are.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needa replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a yon of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

There is no reason we cant go nuclear and stay nuclear. Its cleaner and more efficient than renewables will ever be.

"1733",1018,"FranciscoGalt",10,10,1015,1,0,"A reason to get rid of nuclear is that it's more costly to operate than to shut it down. It's happening all over the world. Where it's cheaper it shouldn't be shut down though.

Most (97%+) solar panels don't have toxic metals whatsoever. You're confusing CdTe solar panels which were big in the 90s with CSi panels which are just about all of the market today. Solar panels can last up to 40 years no problem.

Solar panel and wind energy payback is now less than 2 years. Again, this number was higher than 10-15 years in the 90s. This means that even if they were built on 100% fossil fuels, they'll generate at least 10x more clean energy.

There have been no utility scale battery accidents, let alone explosions. There are also commercially available, economic battery configurations such as LiFePo4 and iron-salt that are non-toxic, not flammable, not explosive, and have much longer lifespans than Li-ion.

There's no such thing as a ""nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house"". Nuclear today needs to be massive to be economically viable and incredibly regulated to prohibit nuclear weapons development. There is technology being developed that could allow nuclear to scale down. But then again there's also technology that could allow solar to be beamed down from space 24/7 (point being, let's stick to reality).

There are solar+storage projects today that are cheaper than new nuclear. Solar+storage has been decreasing  in price by 10% year over year while nuclear keeps getting more expensive (blame red tape, regulation, a contracting industry, whatever. Still less competitive each year).

Renewables by definition have no fuel cost, which means most of their cost is in CAPEX. Nuclear has tremendous capex and opex. If it didn't, they wouldn't be shutting them down.

Nuclear could be the future in 2 or 3 generations of improvements to the technology. Today it is completely dead as it is expensive to build, operate, and there doesn't seem any indication of it getting better. All the while renewables are constantly getting cheaper and making it harder for nuclear to catch up.

So, if your power company is charging you extra for ""green energy"" you should understand that it really isn't coming from renewable sources, but from a conglomeration of sources: coal, natural gas, biomass, and renewables, etc. They just ""buy"" credits from ""green"" power sources to offset the amount of power they are providing to their consumers. It's a big scam. They can even buy green credits from investments into their future ""green energy"" sources..."

"1775",581,"kd8azz",10,8,575,3,0,"(Yes, I know carbon-neutral and renewable are different things, but saying it this way gives me four bullets instead of three.)  I can think of four different definitions of carbon-neutral, when it comes to an electrical grid.

* I buy a kWh worth of carbon offsets for every kWh of electricity I use.
* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.
* Bullet #2, and the carbon-neutral electricity I'm buying is also the geographically closest electricity source, to me, so I'm probably actually using it.
* There are literally zero carbon-burning electricity sources on my grid.


&gt; This is totally impossible without disconnecting from the power grid entirely.

This argues for bullet #4, which is indeed the best.  But I'd argue bullet #3 is probably sufficient.

&gt; How do you think power is being delivered when the sun isnt shining and the wind isnt blowing?

Hopefully storage.  But you're probably right and we're probably back to bullet #2, which is unfortunate.

My house runs on bullet #2.  Bullet #3 can happen with variable pricing and a battery.  If variable pricing was available in my area, I'd buy a battery."
"1776",1029,"wolfkeeper",10,10,581,3,0,"If I've understood you correctly, there's another carbon neutral system, where there's (say) solar connected on the grid, and it's owned by a producer, who is being paid by customers, who take their electricity from the grid and get metered in the completely normal way.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

Batteries cannot make up for the amount of power required on the grid. Renewables aren't even keeping up with the increase in power demand from year to year. Storage is a big problem to be solved. 

If people are talking about net use, then consider then whole country as net use, not just a single community. Of course a single community could generate more than they use in terms of renewable energy, but overall, the total electrical production from renewables is barely a fraction of the total energy required to power a city.

If we're being real about people's motivations and fears and what we can achieve, it's just easier to go with wind and solar. In the medium term (5-10 years) countries with a higher percentage of renewables will have a significant competitive advantage with lower electricity costs for automated manufacturing.

If we're being honest it's not about saving the world. Most renewable energy projects are just win-win situations (good returns, cheaper electricity and as a kicker, it's clean) that nuclear can't offer. It's why the Kyoto protocol was a failure and the París climate accords a success: people can now make money out of saving the planet. 

Nuclear (today) doesn't offer that.

Lets keep investing in safer, cheaper, smaller nuclear to someday get it where it needs to be. But promoting nuclear fission as if it can actually solve something today is like promoting fusion. Nice to have, but a pipe dream.

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

You're first three sentences are fine, but these plants are not old, not falling apart, and not producing anymore waste compared to other sources of energy. They were built to run for 60 years and they should all achieve that, with most of the plants going over past the design base and running for 80 years.  There is so much oversight from the NRC to Exelon/s own oversight that broken stuff just doesn't go unnoticed. I'm also guessing your'e thinking of other political parties that want to shut down nuclear because Illinois is fine with it, half of the electricity illinois produced comes from nuclear power. You also must have missed where the state lawmakers passed a law to help out Quad/Clinton compete against power producers. The thing about Dresden is bs too, if you lose primary containment, you shut down now. There is no rely on secondary containment, you shut down and fix it. "

Nobody is arguing that the small amount of installed capacity of renewables we already have is having a major impact on CO2 emissions today. That's absurd. 

The relevant claim is that replacing a substantial portion of the energy mix with renewables would reduce emissions, which it obviously and incontrovertibly would.

But your original post made the nonsensical claim that renewables will actually increase emissions in the future:

&gt; This is how we slide our way into global warming

. 
 
&gt; The carbon dioxide inevitably produced by coal plants and CCGTs when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine doesn't go away.

That is completely incoherent. Coal and gas will be used to produce power that renewables don't produce, just as they will be used to produce power that nuclear plants don't produce. The solution to emissions from coal and gas is ... to replace them...

Now maybe you're trying to make some screwy sideways point about intermittancy being an issue, but of course it isn't because large scale stationary energy storage is now cost-effective - as the recent success in Australia showed last year, which motivated PG&amp;E in California to buy the equivalent of 17 of the Australian Hornsdale Power Reserve batteries. And as for coal and gas, that one battery decimated 55% of the gas peaking power plant market in South Australia overnight when it went operational.

Again, none of this is controversial or even questioned among investors and experts in the energy sector. It's why Toshiba and Hitachi and Exelon are all exiting the nuclear power industry.

We've spent far more on those renewables than we did on nuclear energy.  It seems only right we expect the same return on the money we flushed down that hole.

&gt;The relevant claim is that replacing a substantial portion of the energy mix with renewables would reduce emissions, which it obviously and incontrovertibly would.

Germany claims to generate 37% of their energy from renewable sources, yet their carbon emissions have remained fixed.  Is 37% not 'substantial'?

&gt;Coal and gas will be used to produce power that renewables don't produce, just as they will be used to produce power that nuclear plants don't produce. 

Nuclear reactors have far greater up time and capacity factors than wind and solar.  Their downtimes are programmed and scheduled such that other reactors can pick up the slack for one unit being taken offline for maintenance.  That greatly reduces the carbon emissions from the units being offline.

&gt;And as for coal and gas, that one battery decimated 55% of the gas peaking power plant market in South Australia overnight when it went operational.

Again, this is so extraordinarily incorrect as that is most definitely not what happened.  The battery did not reduce the use of gas, only the ability of the company providing it to charge a premium for responding to second-to-second changes in frequency caused by intermittent renewables.  The batteries in question have zero capability to supply the grid as a whole for more than a few minutes, but can absorb and feed power to the grid such that they reduce the impact of renewables' intermittency on the grid.  This is absolutely the right role for batteries on the grid, but it's orders of magnitude short of what is required for day-to-day operations on a 100% renewable grid and it's patently dishonest to pretend otherwise."

Chicago can be considered the nuclear city because the [Chicago Pile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1), the first controllable nuclear reactor, was located under Stagg Field at the University of Chicago.  It is fortunate that the city later had a number of nuclear reactors constructed around it as that undoubtedly saved untold thousands of lives.  

However, despite your assertion, none of the nuclear reactors around Chicago are located in the city limits, and the State of Illinois has seen their value.  Chicago is not phasing out nuclear energy by any stretch of the imagination."

This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

- ~4.9% fission products, most of which fissile out into inert materials in months

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.

"2054",1111,"ServetusM",11,11,1109,7,0,"Except literally every point he made about it was wrong. First, we can repurpose it, and/or force it to decompose. There are special reactors which can turn nuclear waste inert (Or make it slightly less dangerous than natural radioactive material you'd find in the ground--which makes it simple to store.) 

You can also use those special reactors to create energy. Or you can ""recharge"" the waste and use it in the same reactor that created it. France actually revitalizes a portion of its waste to use as fuel (And this process slowly degrades the waste, making it less and less radioactive.) 

Now, people may wonder why we don't do these things. The answer is? Its cheaper just to store and dig up more. Part of the reason for that is the enormous amount of red tape surrounding everything nuclear. Even moving the stuff costs a ton of money due to the security restrictions. (The military actually requires less security around its nuclear projects than the civilian sector is required to have.) In addition, its extremely hard to build new facilities due to this same red tape, especially specialty facilities.

This creates a kind of self fulfilling prophecy, too. Because it forces us to rely on older reactors--which are less safe. Fukishima for example--we predicted and solved the problem in Fukishima decades ago. U.S. reactors, under the same conditions, would not have had an accident. But because of the red tape? Well...(It's like if the government prevented new cars from being built to ""keep the roads safe"", and forced everyone to drive cars from the 60's--and because those designs are far less safe, more people die, so the government imposes more restrictions, ensuring cars from the 60's remain in use forever.)"

Chernobyl had a positive temperature reactivity coefficient, which means as the temperature goes up (like in a meltdown), reactivity goes up. So the hotter it gets, the faster it gets hot. American reactors have negative coefficients, which means if they get too hot, they shut down automatically. The fuel itself will remain hot, but it won't be like Chernobyl. 

There actually was a catastrophic failure and partial meltdown in an American power plant at 3 mile island. There were no deaths and no injuries, and that plant was in the middle of Philadelphia. It's still operating. The safety features worked well.

&gt;1. nuclear waste that we still can't decompose or repurpose(or apparently permanently store)

Absolutely false. We can reprocess nuclear waste into more fuel. We can continue reprocessing until the ""Waste"" (which isn't really waste) is literally gone. More inert than a common rock.

We dont do this because now of some 1960's fears of nuclear proliferation. The level of reprocessing for fuel is much lower than what is needed for weapons though. The technology already exists, and some companies do it for various purposes under a very watchful eye.

&gt; 2. A catastrophic failure has greater environmental consequences.

Again, absolutely false. Not a single nuclear accident has caused environmental damage. Even Chernobyl has 1) had people living on it since the day of the disaster. Google it. Time has an article on them.

2) Flora and Fauna in the Chernobyl exclusion zone are *exploding* compared to their else-located counterparts. Studies are ongoing to see if its something to do woth the accident, or just the absence of humans.

&gt;However, the short term is better for the environment, and is potentially mobile with some advancement in tech.  Its also safer in when you compare failure rates of coal plants to nuclear plants, for obvious reasons.

Short term, long term, and until we get fusion power working. We need nuclear *right now*. We could solve the energy side of climate change in 5 years if we put the money where our mouths were and got over this ridiculous misinformation campaign, which you are (unwittingly?) part of.

Also, were developing new reactors that can use this nuclear waste. 


2. The reactors we have today are safer than Chernobyl by a factor of ten or more, reactors that we can build right now are safer by a factor of 100. Reactors under development will even be unable to undergo meltdown. Furthermore, a catastrophic meltdown isnt as bad as you think. Fukushima and Chernobyl are the only examples of a true catastrophic failure. 64 people have died to Chernobyl while none have died in Fukushima (the fearmongering and panic has killed more people there than actual radiation).

OK, easy fix, don't be incompetent morons like the Soviets were at Chernobyl and don't build nuclear power plants on active faults next to the coast. Every other nuclear power incident in history has been blown out of proportion without actually causing deaths or more radiation to be released then what you'd get from an x-ray.   


This isn't actually an issue. I know that it sounds like it is, because nuclear is a scary word and the anti-nuclear movement has been so insanely successful with their propaganda. Do your own research on nuclear disasters, find out how many power stations there are and how little they've done. Then look at their emission costs even relative to solar and wind (over the entire industry, nuclear creates most of its emissions via uranium mining---which is far less than the impact of mining and creation of solar panels/wind turbines and especially the batteries we'd need to actually run a stable grid with those.)

And Fukushima was 40 year old badly maintained technology with a flawed plant design (underground backup power on a coastal site on a fault line = facepalm) and a foreseeable natural disaster.

"2113",803,"caesarfecit",11,9,526,21,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"2114",804,"LLJKTympanic",11,9,526,18,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

"2127",530,"GlowingGreenie",11,8,529,1,0,"&gt;mostly that hastelloy isnt rated for long-term radiation exposure

Hastelloy is required for fluoride reactors, but of course not all fluid fueled reactors use fluoride.  Chloride reactors are being pursued and the corrosion is easier to manage. IINM stainless steel is an NRC accepted material for handling chlorinated actinides.

&gt;the chemistry for reprocessing the fissile salts being bred from thorium isnt mature, i think

Again, that is a specific design aspect of the liquid fluoride thorium reactor, but not all molten salt reactors use fluoride salts, or require chemical processing systems to filter uranium out of the blanket salt.  A chloride fast reactor, for example, can breed and consume thorium in-situ while not requiring chemical processing of the salt to isolate actinides.  Instead fission products are drawn off, leaving the fissile and fertile materials to burn up.

&gt;thorium is definitely the easiest path to making more energy than we can possibly use, but its not ready. yet.

I'm fuel and reactor agnostic, but for the moment I'd argue spent nuclear fuel, weapons/reactor grade plutonium, and depleted/natural uranium present an easier path to using nuclear energy in the next decade.  A chloride fast reactor can be all the things promised by the LFTR while eliminating lithium enrichment, graphite moderators in the core, and enabling the burnup of long lived transuranic elements.  And IMHO the ten years required to develop and deploy LFTRs, MCFRs, IMSRs, SSRs, and other variations on the molten salt reactor is likely to still be much less than is required for electrical storage to displace fossil fuels.

&gt; imagine if the amount of money being spent on fusion was being spent on thorium reactors. well, theres china, theyre definitely working on thorium. but i digress.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

There is no reason we cant go nuclear and stay nuclear. Its cleaner and more efficient than renewables will ever be.

Most (97%+) solar panels don't have toxic metals whatsoever. You're confusing CdTe solar panels which were big in the 90s with CSi panels which are just about all of the market today. Solar panels can last up to 40 years no problem.

Solar panel and wind energy payback is now less than 2 years. Again, this number was higher than 10-15 years in the 90s. This means that even if they were built on 100% fossil fuels, they'll generate at least 10x more clean energy.

There have been no utility scale battery accidents, let alone explosions. There are also commercially available, economic battery configurations such as LiFePo4 and iron-salt that are non-toxic, not flammable, not explosive, and have much longer lifespans than Li-ion.

There's no such thing as a ""nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house"". Nuclear today needs to be massive to be economically viable and incredibly regulated to prohibit nuclear weapons development. There is technology being developed that could allow nuclear to scale down. But then again there's also technology that could allow solar to be beamed down from space 24/7 (point being, let's stick to reality).

There are solar+storage projects today that are cheaper than new nuclear. Solar+storage has been decreasing  in price by 10% year over year while nuclear keeps getting more expensive (blame red tape, regulation, a contracting industry, whatever. Still less competitive each year).

Renewables by definition have no fuel cost, which means most of their cost is in CAPEX. Nuclear has tremendous capex and opex. If it didn't, they wouldn't be shutting them down.

Nuclear could be the future in 2 or 3 generations of improvements to the technology. Today it is completely dead as it is expensive to build, operate, and there doesn't seem any indication of it getting better. All the while renewables are constantly getting cheaper and making it harder for nuclear to catch up.

* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

Batteries cannot make up for the amount of power required on the grid. Renewables aren't even keeping up with the increase in power demand from year to year. Storage is a big problem to be solved.

True, today you'll need gas peakers to compensate for intermittency. But you'll be able to decrease emissions by 80-90% in a couple of years. And even those will be replaced by batteries in a couple of years (and yes, there are non-toxic batteries available).

If we're being real about people's motivations and fears and what we can achieve, it's just easier to go with wind and solar. In the medium term (5-10 years) countries with a higher percentage of renewables will have a significant competitive advantage with lower electricity costs for automated manufacturing.

If we're being honest it's not about saving the world. Most renewable energy projects are just win-win situations (good returns, cheaper electricity and as a kicker, it's clean) that nuclear can't offer. It's why the Kyoto protocol was a failure and the París climate accords a success: people can now make money out of saving the planet. 

Nuclear (today) doesn't offer that.

Lets keep investing in safer, cheaper, smaller nuclear to someday get it where it needs to be. But promoting nuclear fission as if it can actually solve something today is like promoting fusion. Nice to have, but a pipe dream.

It's green, emissions-wise, but f-ing expensive just to build, let alone to dispose of the waste long-term. Oh, and building a new plant takes a looooong time. 

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

But this is r/futurology, not r/rightnow.  There are a number of companies developing reactors which are safer, lower cost, more efficient, and even able to consume the waste products from our existing reactor fleet.  At least some of those companies will encounter commercial success before we can reach the point where significant storage can be rolled out at the grid level.

&gt;Itd be less expensive, quicker, and far less labor intensive to build a gigawatt of generation from solar or wind.

But that gigawatt of installed capacity only has a capacity factor of 20 to 30 percent.  You'd have to install a nameplate capacity of upwards of 3 gigawatts to get the same energy out of that renewables installation on a consistent basis.  That would of course bring with it the greater ecological impact that comes with distributed generation.

I think you're massively underestimating the support required to keep solar and wind farms going.  Even residential rooftop solar companies employ tens of thousands of maintenance personnel to deal with customer issues.

Nobody is arguing that the small amount of installed capacity of renewables we already have is having a major impact on CO2 emissions today. That's absurd. 

The relevant claim is that replacing a substantial portion of the energy mix with renewables would reduce emissions, which it obviously and incontrovertibly would.

But your original post made the nonsensical claim that renewables will actually increase emissions in the future:

&gt; This is how we slide our way into global warming

. 
 
&gt; The carbon dioxide inevitably produced by coal plants and CCGTs when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine doesn't go away.

That is completely incoherent. Coal and gas will be used to produce power that renewables don't produce, just as they will be used to produce power that nuclear plants don't produce. The solution to emissions from coal and gas is ... to replace them...

Now maybe you're trying to make some screwy sideways point about intermittancy being an issue, but of course it isn't because large scale stationary energy storage is now cost-effective - as the recent success in Australia showed last year, which motivated PG&amp;E in California to buy the equivalent of 17 of the Australian Hornsdale Power Reserve batteries. And as for coal and gas, that one battery decimated 55% of the gas peaking power plant market in South Australia overnight when it went operational.

Again, none of this is controversial or even questioned among investors and experts in the energy sector. It's why Toshiba and Hitachi and Exelon are all exiting the nuclear power industry. Anyone who wants more details can look at my other posts where I run through all of the relevant figures on cost that have sealed the fate of the nuclear power industry."

We've spent far more on those renewables than we did on nuclear energy.  It seems only right we expect the same return on the money we flushed down that hole.

&gt;The relevant claim is that replacing a substantial portion of the energy mix with renewables would reduce emissions, which it obviously and incontrovertibly would.

Germany claims to generate 37% of their energy from renewable sources, yet their carbon emissions have remained fixed.  Is 37% not 'substantial'?

&gt;Coal and gas will be used to produce power that renewables don't produce, just as they will be used to produce power that nuclear plants don't produce. 

Nuclear reactors have far greater up time and capacity factors than wind and solar.  Their downtimes are programmed and scheduled such that other reactors can pick up the slack for one unit being taken offline for maintenance.  That greatly reduces the carbon emissions from the units being offline.

&gt;And as for coal and gas, that one battery decimated 55% of the gas peaking power plant market in South Australia overnight when it went operational.

Again, this is so extraordinarily incorrect as that is most definitely not what happened.  The battery did not reduce the use of gas, only the ability of the company providing it to charge a premium for responding to second-to-second changes in frequency caused by intermittent renewables.  The batteries in question have zero capability to supply the grid as a whole for more than a few minutes, but can absorb and feed power to the grid such that they reduce the impact of renewables' intermittency on the grid.  This is absolutely the right role for batteries on the grid, but it's orders of magnitude short of what is required for day-to-day operations on a 100% renewable grid and it's patently dishonest to pretend otherwise."

Two separate things. That's why we call it _fear-mongering_.

There's waste that's dangerous. It has a half-life of 30 years. The faster it burns, the more dangerous it is.

If we actually removed the scary dangerous stuff, _like France does_, our nuclear waste would be:

- ~95% recycled fuel that we put back into reactors instead of digging more up
- ~4.9% fission products, most of which fissile out into inert materials in months
- ~0.04% caesium, the stuff _that actually makes up nearly all of the radioactivity_, that will basically cease to exist in 300 years and have 0.1% of its radioactivity left after 100 years
- ~0.8% plutonium"

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."

Let's make it solely about cost not caring that we're generating hazardous waste that will stay hazardous for generations.

Nuclear power is not a sustainable technology for this simple reason. So why bother when there is wind, solar both heat transfer and photovoltaic, geothermal, hydroelectric, and other technologies that don't leave a giant mess for the future to deal with? 

So why spend money on what is basically a dead end? This technology exists now and we could power the entire world with it:

There are so many redundant systems in place to prevent catastrophic failure, that even in our simulators that we train on, they have a hard time actually causing any kind of release to the environment. Reactor operators are trained for two years before they are even given the chance to take the test to get their license. And that license is given by the NRC, not the company.

"2519",1273,"ServetusM",12,12,996,9,0,"Except literally every point he made about it was wrong. First, we can repurpose it, and/or force it to decompose. There are special reactors which can turn nuclear waste inert (Or make it slightly less dangerous than natural radioactive material you'd find in the ground--which makes it simple to store.) 

You can also use those special reactors to create energy. Or you can ""recharge"" the waste and use it in the same reactor that created it. France actually revitalizes a portion of its waste to use as fuel (And this process slowly degrades the waste, making it less and less radioactive.) 

Now, people may wonder why we don't do these things. The answer is? Its cheaper just to store and dig up more. Part of the reason for that is the enormous amount of red tape surrounding everything nuclear. Even moving the stuff costs a ton of money due to the security restrictions. (The military actually requires less security around its nuclear projects than the civilian sector is required to have.) In addition, its extremely hard to build new facilities due to this same red tape, especially specialty facilities.

This creates a kind of self fulfilling prophecy, too. Because it forces us to rely on older reactors--which are less safe. Fukishima for example--we predicted and solved the problem in Fukishima decades ago. U.S. reactors, under the same conditions, would not have had an accident. But because of the red tape? Well...(It's like if the government prevented new cars from being built to ""keep the roads safe"", and forced everyone to drive cars from the 60's--and because those designs are far less safe, more people die, so the government imposes more restrictions, ensuring cars from the 60's remain in use forever.)"

Chernobyl had a positive temperature reactivity coefficient, which means as the temperature goes up (like in a meltdown), reactivity goes up. So the hotter it gets, the faster it gets hot.

&gt;2 parts to consider about nuclear power, 
&gt;1. nuclear waste that we still can't decompose or repurpose(or apparently permanently store)

Absolutely false. We can reprocess nuclear waste into more fuel. We can continue reprocessing until the ""Waste"" (which isn't really waste) is literally gone. More inert than a common rock.

We dont do this because now of some 1960's fears of nuclear proliferation. The level of reprocessing for fuel is much lower than what is needed for weapons though. The technology already exists, and some companies do it for various purposes under a very watchful eye.

&gt; 2. A catastrophic failure has greater environmental consequences.

Again, absolutely false. Not a single nuclear accident has caused environmental damage. Even Chernobyl has 1) had people living on it since the day of the disaster. Google it. Time has an article on them.

2) Flora and Fauna in the Chernobyl exclusion zone are *exploding* compared to their else-located counterparts. Studies are ongoing to see if its something to do woth the accident, or just the absence of humans.

&gt;However, the short term is better for the environment, and is potentially mobile with some advancement in tech.  Its also safer in when you compare failure rates of coal plants to nuclear plants, for obvious reasons.

Short term, long term, and until we get fusion power working. We need nuclear *right now*. We could solve the energy side of climate change in 5 years if we put the money where our mouths were and got over this ridiculous misinformation campaign, which you are (unwittingly?) part of.

2. The reactors we have today are safer than Chernobyl by a factor of ten or more, reactors that we can build right now are safer by a factor of 100. Reactors under development will even be unable to undergo meltdown. Furthermore, a catastrophic meltdown isnt as bad as you think. Fukushima and Chernobyl are the only examples of a true catastrophic failure. 64 people have died to Chernobyl while none have died in Fukushima (the fearmongering and panic has killed more people there than actual radiation).

OK, easy fix, don't be incompetent morons like the Soviets were at Chernobyl and don't build nuclear power plants on active faults next to the coast. Every other nuclear power incident in history has been blown out of proportion without actually causing deaths or more radiation to be released then what you'd get from an x-ray.   


This isn't actually an issue. I know that it sounds like it is, because nuclear is a scary word and the anti-nuclear movement has been so insanely successful with their propaganda. Do your own research on nuclear disasters, find out how many power stations there are and how little they've done. Then look at their emission costs even relative to solar and wind (over the entire industry, nuclear creates most of its emissions via uranium mining---which is far less than the impact of mining and creation of solar panels/wind turbines and especially the batteries we'd need to actually run a stable grid with those.)

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

No, they aren't. [Advanced nuclear is much cheaper](https://www.innovationreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Advanced-Nuclear-Reactors-Cost-Study.pdf) than renewables **without storage**. 

I challenge you to provide a source that says a full renewable package (solar, wind, and storage) *above the break even MW generation*, since you cant just break even with renewables, is cheaper than a nuclear plant.

&gt;They can also be deployed within a couple years and investors can be paid back before a nuke plant even comes online.  

Lol No. None of that is true. Again, source.

 &gt;Theres lots of dirty energy for us to replace and the world continues to consume more of it. 

Renewables are one of those dirty energy sources. They should be kept to small-scale private endeavors. If Mr.Smith wants to solarize his house, then fine. If Google wants to solarize their HQ, then fine. The main bulk of power generation for our world should absolutely be nuclear."

"2636",831,"FranciscoGalt",12,9,152,1,0,"A reason to get rid of nuclear is that it's more costly to operate than to shut it down. It's happening all over the world. Where it's cheaper it shouldn't be shut down though.

Most (97%+) solar panels don't have toxic metals whatsoever. You're confusing CdTe solar panels which were big in the 90s with CSi panels which are just about all of the market today. Solar panels can last up to 40 years no problem.

Solar panel and wind energy payback is now less than 2 years. Again, this number was higher than 10-15 years in the 90s. This means that even if they were built on 100% fossil fuels, they'll generate at least 10x more clean energy.

There have been no utility scale battery accidents, let alone explosions. There are also commercially available, economic battery configurations such as LiFePo4 and iron-salt that are non-toxic, not flammable, not explosive, and have much longer lifespans than Li-ion.

There's no such thing as a ""nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house"". Nuclear today needs to be massive to be economically viable and incredibly regulated to prohibit nuclear weapons development. There is technology being developed that could allow nuclear to scale down. But then again there's also technology that could allow solar to be beamed down from space 24/7 (point being, let's stick to reality).

There are solar+storage projects today that are cheaper than new nuclear. Solar+storage has been decreasing  in price by 10% year over year while nuclear keeps getting more expensive (blame red tape, regulation, a contracting industry, whatever. Still less competitive each year).

Renewables by definition have no fuel cost, which means most of their cost is in CAPEX. Nuclear has tremendous capex and opex. If it didn't, they wouldn't be shutting them down.

Nuclear could be the future in 2 or 3 generations of improvements to the technology. Today it is completely dead as it is expensive to build, operate, and there doesn't seem any indication of it getting better. All the while renewables are constantly getting cheaper and making it harder for nuclear to catch up.

* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

Batteries cannot make up for the amount of power required on the grid. Renewables aren't even keeping up with the increase in power demand from year to year. Storage is a big problem to be solved. 

If people are talking about net use, then consider then whole country as net use, not just a single community.

The grid may be connected across a pretty large distance but power isn't really sent that far in comparison to the three u.s. grids sizes.  Sending the energy from Arizona where the sun is intense all the way up to Colorado because it's overcast is incredibly inefficient.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I almost forgot...  I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.  Look into dry cask storage and you'll see what I mean.  All the fuel we've used since the plant was commissioned is stored safely on site using this dry cask storage program."

Nobody is arguing that the small amount of installed capacity of renewables we already have is having a major impact on CO2 emissions today. That's absurd. 

The relevant claim is that replacing a substantial portion of the energy mix with renewables would reduce emissions, which it obviously and incontrovertibly would.

But your original post made the nonsensical claim that renewables will actually increase emissions in the future:

&gt; This is how we slide our way into global warming

. 
 
&gt; The carbon dioxide inevitably produced by coal plants and CCGTs when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine doesn't go away.

That is completely incoherent. Coal and gas will be used to produce power that renewables don't produce, just as they will be used to produce power that nuclear plants don't produce. The solution to emissions from coal and gas is ... to replace them...

Now maybe you're trying to make some screwy sideways point about intermittancy being an issue, but of course it isn't because large scale stationary energy storage is now cost-effective - as the recent success in Australia showed last year, which motivated PG&amp;E in California to buy the equivalent of 17 of the Australian Hornsdale Power Reserve batteries. And as for coal and gas, that one battery decimated 55% of the gas peaking power plant market in South Australia overnight when it went operational.

Again, none of this is controversial or even questioned among investors and experts in the energy sector. It's why Toshiba and Hitachi and Exelon are all exiting the nuclear power industry. Anyone who wants more details can look at my other posts where I run through all of the relevant figures on cost that have sealed the fate of the nuclear power industry."

We've spent far more on those renewables than we did on nuclear energy.  It seems only right we expect the same return on the money we flushed down that hole.

&gt;The relevant claim is that replacing a substantial portion of the energy mix with renewables would reduce emissions, which it obviously and incontrovertibly would.

Germany claims to generate 37% of their energy from renewable sources, yet their carbon emissions have remained fixed.  Is 37% not 'substantial'?

&gt;Coal and gas will be used to produce power that renewables don't produce, just as they will be used to produce power that nuclear plants don't produce. 

Nuclear reactors have far greater up time and capacity factors than wind and solar.  Their downtimes are programmed and scheduled such that other reactors can pick up the slack for one unit being taken offline for maintenance.  That greatly reduces the carbon emissions from the units being offline.

&gt;And as for coal and gas, that one battery decimated 55% of the gas peaking power plant market in South Australia overnight when it went operational.

Again, this is so extraordinarily incorrect as that is most definitely not what happened.  The battery did not reduce the use of gas, only the ability of the company providing it to charge a premium for responding to second-to-second changes in frequency caused by intermittent renewables.  The batteries in question have zero capability to supply the grid as a whole for more than a few minutes, but can absorb and feed power to the grid such that they reduce the impact of renewables' intermittency on the grid.

Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition).

Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.

There are so many redundant systems in place to prevent catastrophic failure, that even in our simulators that we train on, they have a hard time actually causing any kind of release to the environment.

"2971",1421,"ServetusM",13,13,1141,9,0,"Except literally every point he made about it was wrong. First, we can repurpose it, and/or force it to decompose. There are special reactors which can turn nuclear waste inert (Or make it slightly less dangerous than natural radioactive material you'd find in the ground--which makes it simple to store.) 

You can also use those special reactors to create energy. Or you can ""recharge"" the waste and use it in the same reactor that created it. France actually revitalizes a portion of its waste to use as fuel (And this process slowly degrades the waste, making it less and less radioactive.) 

Now, people may wonder why we don't do these things. The answer is? Its cheaper just to store and dig up more. Part of the reason for that is the enormous amount of red tape surrounding everything nuclear. Even moving the stuff costs a ton of money due to the security restrictions. (The military actually requires less security around its nuclear projects than the civilian sector is required to have.) In addition, its extremely hard to build new facilities due to this same red tape, especially specialty facilities.

This creates a kind of self fulfilling prophecy, too. Because it forces us to rely on older reactors--which are less safe. Fukishima for example--we predicted and solved the problem in Fukishima decades ago. U.S. reactors, under the same conditions, would not have had an accident. But because of the red tape? Well...(It's like if the government prevented new cars from being built to ""keep the roads safe"", and forced everyone to drive cars from the 60's--and because those designs are far less safe, more people die, so the government imposes more restrictions, ensuring cars from the 60's remain in use forever.)"

Chernobyl had a positive temperature reactivity coefficient, which means as the temperature goes up (like in a meltdown), reactivity goes up. So the hotter it gets, the faster it gets hot.

&gt;1. nuclear waste that we still can't decompose or repurpose(or apparently permanently store)

Absolutely false. We can reprocess nuclear waste into more fuel. We can continue reprocessing until the ""Waste"" (which isn't really waste) is literally gone. More inert than a common rock.

We dont do this because now of some 1960's fears of nuclear proliferation. The level of reprocessing for fuel is much lower than what is needed for weapons though. The technology already exists, and some companies do it for various purposes under a very watchful eye.

&gt; 2. A catastrophic failure has greater environmental consequences.

Again, absolutely false. Not a single nuclear accident has caused environmental damage. Even Chernobyl has 1) had people living on it since the day of the disaster. Google it. Time has an article on them.

2) Flora and Fauna in the Chernobyl exclusion zone are *exploding* compared to their else-located counterparts. Studies are ongoing to see if its something to do woth the accident, or just the absence of humans.

&gt;However, the short term is better for the environment, and is potentially mobile with some advancement in tech.  Its also safer in when you compare failure rates of coal plants to nuclear plants, for obvious reasons.

Short term, long term, and until we get fusion power working. We need nuclear *right now*. We could solve the energy side of climate change in 5 years if we put the money where our mouths were and got over this ridiculous misinformation campaign, which you are (unwittingly?) part of.

Nuclear is also safer than all renewables, even when compared to each individually. Its also cleaner to produce than solar panels, wind turbines, and especially batteries needed to go along with those."

We also produce a tiny amount of waste, essentially an Olympic swimming pool of waste every year which is nothing compared to other sources of energy. Also, were developing new reactors that can use this nuclear waste. 


2. The reactors we have today are safer than Chernobyl by a factor of ten or more, reactors that we can build right now are safer by a factor of 100. Reactors under development will even be unable to undergo meltdown. Furthermore, a catastrophic meltdown isnt as bad as you think. Fukushima and Chernobyl are the only examples of a true catastrophic failure. 64 people have died to Chernobyl while none have died in Fukushima (the fearmongering and panic has killed more people there than actual radiation). Compare that to coal which kills thousands in the US annually or to solar power which kills 16x more people than nuclear per Gigawatt produced. "

OK, easy fix, don't be incompetent morons like the Soviets were at Chernobyl and don't build nuclear power plants on active faults next to the coast. Every other nuclear power incident in history has been blown out of proportion without actually causing deaths or more radiation to be released then what you'd get from an x-ray.   


This isn't actually an issue. I know that it sounds like it is, because nuclear is a scary word and the anti-nuclear movement has been so insanely successful with their propaganda. Do your own research on nuclear disasters, find out how many power stations there are and how little they've done. Then look at their emission costs even relative to solar and wind (over the entire industry, nuclear creates most of its emissions via uranium mining---which is far less than the impact of mining and creation of solar panels/wind turbines and especially the batteries we'd need to actually run a stable grid with those.)

"3010",1444,"caesarfecit",13,13,38,33,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"3011",1445,"LLJKTympanic",13,13,38,21,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

&gt;

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs. 

Agree with everything else though. As annoying as INPO can be at times, it's certainly better to have it than not."

"3023",1457,"GlowingGreenie",13,13,1456,2,0,"&gt;mostly that hastelloy isnt rated for long-term radiation exposure

Hastelloy is required for fluoride reactors, but of course not all fluid fueled reactors use fluoride.  Chloride reactors are being pursued and the corrosion is easier to manage. IINM stainless steel is an NRC accepted material for handling chlorinated actinides.

&gt;the chemistry for reprocessing the fissile salts being bred from thorium isnt mature, i think

Again, that is a specific design aspect of the liquid fluoride thorium reactor, but not all molten salt reactors use fluoride salts, or require chemical processing systems to filter uranium out of the blanket salt.  A chloride fast reactor, for example, can breed and consume thorium in-situ while not requiring chemical processing of the salt to isolate actinides.  Instead fission products are drawn off, leaving the fissile and fertile materials to burn up.

&gt;thorium is definitely the easiest path to making more energy than we can possibly use, but its not ready. yet.

I'm fuel and reactor agnostic, but for the moment I'd argue spent nuclear fuel, weapons/reactor grade plutonium, and depleted/natural uranium present an easier path to using nuclear energy in the next decade.  A chloride fast reactor can be all the things promised by the LFTR while eliminating lithium enrichment, graphite moderators in the core, and enabling the burnup of long lived transuranic elements.  And IMHO the ten years required to develop and deploy LFTRs, MCFRs, IMSRs, SSRs, and other variations on the molten salt reactor is likely to still be much less than is required for electrical storage to displace fossil fuels.

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

Do you know how batteries work? Do you remember how a 1mm tolerance error caused an entire line of phones to be recalled since they exploded? Those batteries were the size of business cards. Imagine a *facility full of industrial size batteries*. 

Batteries store energy. Energy is volatile. More energy density in one place means more volatility. Do you need a scientific source for this, or are current events and common knowledge enough?

&gt;pollution

Do you not know how solar panels are produced? Did you know solar and wind are classed as ""pseudo green"" in the scientific field? This is because of the toxic shit they take to produce and maintain. Edit: a better explanation of how bad solar is for the environment:

&gt;Large scale renewables are the cheapest form of NEW energy we can build today.  

No, they aren't. [Advanced nuclear is much cheaper](https://www.innovationreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Advanced-Nuclear-Reactors-Cost-Study.pdf) than renewables **without storage**. 

I challenge you to provide a source that says a full renewable package (solar, wind, and storage) *above the break even MW generation*, since you cant just break even with renewables, is cheaper than a nuclear plant.

&gt;They can also be deployed within a couple years and investors can be paid back before a nuke plant even comes online.  

Lol No. None of that is true. Again, source. 

You know China is exporting nuclear plant construction right? Its extremely profitable for them. I don't see any money-hungry countries exporting renewable plant construction.

&gt;Im not against nuclear, but theres really no need for the fear mongering. 

Two possibilities exist: 1) this is a lie and you are against nuclear. 2) you arent informed enough to be seriously debating the subject.

Take your pick. Nearly every major scientific mind and group is advocating nuclear. From Bill Gates to the UCS. What do you have that disagrees with them?

 &gt;Theres lots of dirty energy for us to replace and the world continues to consume more of it. 

Renewables are one of those dirty energy sources. They should be kept to small-scale private endeavors. If Mr.Smith wants to solarize his house, then fine. If Google wants to solarize their HQ, then fine. The main bulk of power generation for our world should absolutely be nuclear."
"3084",1504,"TonyShmoney",13,13,1501,2,0,"Taking this argument in front of the sort of people who have the power to make it happen would be pointless. They know they can richer from ""renewables""."
"3085",1505,"FranciscoGalt",13,13,1501,1,0,"A reason to get rid of nuclear is that it's more costly to operate than to shut it down. It's happening all over the world. Where it's cheaper it shouldn't be shut down though.

Most (97%+) solar panels don't have toxic metals whatsoever. You're confusing CdTe solar panels which were big in the 90s with CSi panels which are just about all of the market today. Solar panels can last up to 40 years no problem.

Solar panel and wind energy payback is now less than 2 years. Again, this number was higher than 10-15 years in the 90s. This means that even if they were built on 100% fossil fuels, they'll generate at least 10x more clean energy.

There have been no utility scale battery accidents, let alone explosions. There are also commercially available, economic battery configurations such as LiFePo4 and iron-salt that are non-toxic, not flammable, not explosive, and have much longer lifespans than Li-ion.

There's no such thing as a ""nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house"". Nuclear today needs to be massive to be economically viable and incredibly regulated to prohibit nuclear weapons development. There is technology being developed that could allow nuclear to scale down. But then again there's also technology that could allow solar to be beamed down from space 24/7 (point being, let's stick to reality).

There are solar+storage projects today that are cheaper than new nuclear. Solar+storage has been decreasing  in price by 10% year over year while nuclear keeps getting more expensive (blame red tape, regulation, a contracting industry, whatever. Still less competitive each year).

Renewables by definition have no fuel cost, which means most of their cost is in CAPEX. Nuclear has tremendous capex and opex. If it didn't, they wouldn't be shutting them down.

Nuclear could be the future in 2 or 3 generations of improvements to the technology. Today it is completely dead as it is expensive to build, operate, and there doesn't seem any indication of it getting better. All the while renewables are constantly getting cheaper and making it harder for nuclear to catch up.

"3128",1541,"kd8azz",13,13,1537,2,1,"(Yes, I know carbon-neutral and renewable are different things, but saying it this way gives me four bullets instead of three.)  I can think of four different definitions of carbon-neutral, when it comes to an electrical grid.

* I buy a kWh worth of carbon offsets for every kWh of electricity I use.
* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.
* Bullet #2, and the carbon-neutral electricity I'm buying is also the geographically closest electricity source, to me, so I'm probably actually using it.
* There are literally zero carbon-burning electricity sources on my grid.


&gt; This is totally impossible without disconnecting from the power grid entirely.

This argues for bullet #4, which is indeed the best.  But I'd argue bullet #3 is probably sufficient.

&gt; How do you think power is being delivered when the sun isnt shining and the wind isnt blowing?

Hopefully storage.  But you're probably right and we're probably back to bullet #2, which is unfortunate.

My house runs on bullet #2.  Bullet #3 can happen with variable pricing and a battery.  If variable pricing was available in my area, I'd buy a battery."
"3129",1542,"wolfkeeper",13,13,1541,3,0,"If I've understood you correctly, there's another carbon neutral system, where there's (say) solar connected on the grid, and it's owned by a producer, who is being paid by customers, who take their electricity from the grid and get metered in the completely normal way.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

Batteries cannot make up for the amount of power required on the grid. Renewables aren't even keeping up with the increase in power demand from year to year. Storage is a big problem to be solved.

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

The Average age for nuclear plants is like 37 years, and most of the illinois plants are below that.

You're first three sentences are fine, but these plants are not old, not falling apart, and not producing anymore waste compared to other sources of energy. They were built to run for 60 years and they should all achieve that, with most of the plants going over past the design base and running for 80 years.  There is so much oversight from the NRC to Exelon/s own oversight that broken stuff just doesn't go unnoticed. I'm also guessing your'e thinking of other political parties that want to shut down nuclear because Illinois is fine with it, half of the electricity illinois produced comes from nuclear power. You also must have missed where the state lawmakers passed a law to help out Quad/Clinton compete against power producers. The thing about Dresden is bs too, if you lose primary containment, you shut down now. There is no rely on secondary containment, you shut down and fix it. "

In looking at coal plants that converted to natural gas, [it typically takes only a year or two](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Coal_plant_conversion_projects#Natural_gas_conversions) to resume power generation. The owners of these facilities are seldom interested in nuclear plants because it involves huge amounts of time, money, and uncertainty.

Like Marble Hill where they spent [$2.5 billion before canceling it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Hill_Nuclear_Power_Plant) or Bellefonte where they spent [$4 billion before canceling it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellefonte_Nuclear_Plant), or the billions lost at [Virgil C.

Vogtle is still under construction, but [hopes it will be done by its 15th anniversary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogtle_Electric_Generating_Plant).

Here a [research paper form 2013](https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=913633).

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

There's waste that's dangerous. It has a half-life of 30 years. The faster it burns, the more dangerous it is.

If we actually removed the scary dangerous stuff, _like France does_, our nuclear waste would be:

- ~95% recycled fuel that we put back into reactors instead of digging more up
- ~4.9% fission products, most of which fissile out into inert materials in months
- ~0.04% caesium, the stuff _that actually makes up nearly all of the radioactivity_, that will basically cease to exist in 300 years and have 0.1% of its radioactivity left after 100 years

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."

There are special reactors which can turn nuclear waste inert (Or make it slightly less dangerous than natural radioactive material you'd find in the ground--which makes it simple to store.) 

You can also use those special reactors to create energy. Or you can ""recharge"" the waste and use it in the same reactor that created it. France actually revitalizes a portion of its waste to use as fuel (And this process slowly degrades the waste, making it less and less radioactive.) 

Now, people may wonder why we don't do these things. The answer is? Its cheaper just to store and dig up more. Part of the reason for that is the enormous amount of red tape surrounding everything nuclear. Even moving the stuff costs a ton of money due to the security restrictions. (The military actually requires less security around its nuclear projects than the civilian sector is required to have.) In addition, its extremely hard to build new facilities due to this same red tape, especially specialty facilities.

This creates a kind of self fulfilling prophecy, too. Because it forces us to rely on older reactors--which are less safe. Fukishima for example--we predicted and solved the problem in Fukishima decades ago. U.S. reactors, under the same conditions, would not have had an accident. But because of the red tape? Well...(It's like if the government prevented new cars from being built to ""keep the roads safe"", and forced everyone to drive cars from the 60's--and because those designs are far less safe, more people die, so the government imposes more restrictions, ensuring cars from the 60's remain in use forever.)"

&gt;2 parts to consider about nuclear power, 
&gt;1. nuclear waste that we still can't decompose or repurpose(or apparently permanently store)

Absolutely false. We can reprocess nuclear waste into more fuel. We can continue reprocessing until the ""Waste"" (which isn't really waste) is literally gone. More inert than a common rock.

We dont do this because now of some 1960's fears of nuclear proliferation. The level of reprocessing for fuel is much lower than what is needed for weapons though. The technology already exists, and some companies do it for various purposes under a very watchful eye.

&gt; 2. A catastrophic failure has greater environmental consequences.

Again, absolutely false. Not a single nuclear accident has caused environmental damage. Even Chernobyl has 1) had people living on it since the day of the disaster. Google it. Time has an article on them.

2) Flora and Fauna in the Chernobyl exclusion zone are *exploding* compared to their else-located counterparts. Studies are ongoing to see if its something to do woth the accident, or just the absence of humans.

&gt;However, the short term is better for the environment, and is potentially mobile with some advancement in tech.  Its also safer in when you compare failure rates of coal plants to nuclear plants, for obvious reasons.

Short term, long term, and until we get fusion power working. We need nuclear *right now*. We could solve the energy side of climate change in 5 years if we put the money where our mouths were and got over this ridiculous misinformation campaign, which you are (unwittingly?) part of.

Nuclear is also safer than all renewables, even when compared to each individually. Its also cleaner to produce than solar panels, wind turbines, and especially batteries needed to go along with those."

We also produce a tiny amount of waste, essentially an Olympic swimming pool of waste every year which is nothing compared to other sources of energy. Also, were developing new reactors that can use this nuclear waste. 


2. The reactors we have today are safer than Chernobyl by a factor of ten or more, reactors that we can build right now are safer by a factor of 100. Reactors under development will even be unable to undergo meltdown. Furthermore, a catastrophic meltdown isnt as bad as you think. Fukushima and Chernobyl are the only examples of a true catastrophic failure. 64 people have died to Chernobyl while none have died in Fukushima (the fearmongering and panic has killed more people there than actual radiation).

OK, easy fix, don't be incompetent morons like the Soviets were at Chernobyl and don't build nuclear power plants on active faults next to the coast. Every other nuclear power incident in history has been blown out of proportion without actually causing deaths or more radiation to be released then what you'd get from an x-ray.   


This isn't actually an issue. I know that it sounds like it is, because nuclear is a scary word and the anti-nuclear movement has been so insanely successful with their propaganda. Do your own research on nuclear disasters, find out how many power stations there are and how little they've done. Then look at their emission costs even relative to solar and wind (over the entire industry, nuclear creates most of its emissions via uranium mining---which is far less than the impact of mining and creation of solar panels/wind turbines and especially the batteries we'd need to actually run a stable grid with those.)

"3458",1444,"caesarfecit",14,13,38,34,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China).

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs. 

Agree with everything else though. As annoying as INPO can be at times, it's certainly better to have it than not."

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster).

No, they aren't. [Advanced nuclear is much cheaper](https://www.innovationreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Advanced-Nuclear-Reactors-Cost-Study.pdf) than renewables **without storage**. 

I challenge you to provide a source that says a full renewable package (solar, wind, and storage) *above the break even MW generation*, since you cant just break even with renewables, is cheaper than a nuclear plant.

&gt;They can also be deployed within a couple years and investors can be paid back before a nuke plant even comes online.  

Lol No. None of that is true. Again, source.

Take your pick. Nearly every major scientific mind and group is advocating nuclear. From Bill Gates to the UCS. What do you have that disagrees with them?

 &gt;Theres lots of dirty energy for us to replace and the world continues to consume more of it. 

Renewables are one of those dirty energy sources. They should be kept to small-scale private endeavors. If Mr.Smith wants to solarize his house, then fine. If Google wants to solarize their HQ, then fine. The main bulk of power generation for our world should absolutely be nuclear."
"3528",1641,"ClearlyAThrowawai",14,14,1640,1,0,"Batteries arent bombs. They are flammable, sure, but they dont explode with real power - they only explode because of pressure build up, and it doesnt have much power in that release. Regardless, billions upon billions of batteries have been produced, and unprovoked battery fires are vanishingly rare outside of a chronic manufacturing defect, like the Samsung case. Modern batteries, well made, can short, be cut and crushed without serious incident in many cases.

Toxic materials in solar panel manufacture is a solvable problem, and China has put in place regulations to deal with that issue (granted that it used to be a problem, and may still be in older facilities)  and most western countries have systems in place to make sure the problem is dealt with too. It is nowhere near as damaging as you would have people believe.

Renewables currently are cheaper than the best case option in that report, and Im extremely dubious of those numbers, since most conventional nuclear is traditionally much more expensive. With regards to storage, its not necessarily very important if we compromise in the shorter term - grids can work with 50%+ renewable shares of generation if they have LNG plants around. Its not a perfect solution, but its also unrealistic to expect to be able to replace the entire grids generation with alternatives in the short term either.

Its a bit disingenuous to talk about the damaging materials used in solar panels while ignoring the same for nuclear - waste is dangerous and expensive to deal with too, not to mention uranium mining.

Renewables produce more than it costs to make them. Youd think that would be evident, given that they are so cheap, often paying off in a few years, but apparently it is possible to believe the opposite. A solar panel produces its cost in energy in 2 years.

Most (97%+) solar panels don't have toxic metals whatsoever. You're confusing CdTe solar panels which were big in the 90s with CSi panels which are just about all of the market today. Solar panels can last up to 40 years no problem.

Solar panel and wind energy payback is now less than 2 years. Again, this number was higher than 10-15 years in the 90s. This means that even if they were built on 100% fossil fuels, they'll generate at least 10x more clean energy.

There have been no utility scale battery accidents, let alone explosions. There are also commercially available, economic battery configurations such as LiFePo4 and iron-salt that are non-toxic, not flammable, not explosive, and have much longer lifespans than Li-ion.

There's no such thing as a ""nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house"". Nuclear today needs to be massive to be economically viable and incredibly regulated to prohibit nuclear weapons development. There is technology being developed that could allow nuclear to scale down. But then again there's also technology that could allow solar to be beamed down from space 24/7 (point being, let's stick to reality).

There are solar+storage projects today that are cheaper than new nuclear. Solar+storage has been decreasing  in price by 10% year over year while nuclear keeps getting more expensive (blame red tape, regulation, a contracting industry, whatever. Still less competitive each year).

Renewables by definition have no fuel cost, which means most of their cost is in CAPEX. Nuclear has tremendous capex and opex. If it didn't, they wouldn't be shutting them down.

Nuclear could be the future in 2 or 3 generations of improvements to the technology. Today it is completely dead as it is expensive to build, operate, and there doesn't seem any indication of it getting better. All the while renewables are constantly getting cheaper and making it harder for nuclear to catch up.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "
"3607",118,"caesarfecit",14,5,117,9,0,"The reason why they take forever to build is because of the regulatory process in most countries, NIMBY bullshit, and the fact that every power station is ""bespoke"" or a unique project. The reactor designs are similar but their implementation and finer features are often unique to the installation.

There's new designs like the LFTR which are far safer, smaller, and use thorium rather than uranium, which means far less and shorter lived waste.

Nuclear power is the future. Steam engines back in the day were dangerous too. "
"3608",245,"InfanticideAquifer",14,6,118,1,0,"&gt;Steam engines back in the day were dangerous too.

So does that mean your point is ""we should tolerate unsafe nuclear reactors now because they'll be better in the future""? Because I hope that's not your point. There's a big difference between a steam engine and a nuclear reactor. (Even though a nuclear reactor *is* just a steam engine, when you get right down to it.) If a steam engine blows up it just kills the people nearby. No one should be willing to build an unsafe nuclear reactor at any point--even if it will help make them safer in the future. If you're stupid enough with one you poison a whole continent. 

I don't know of any plans to create unsafe reactors. And I don't know of anyone in the world who thinks that's a good idea. But I dunno what else to read into your last sentence there. "

"3611",119,"filbert227",14,5,117,1,0,"The problem is baseload is a lot more complex than just sending power from one region to another.  The grid may be connected across a pretty large distance but power isn't really sent that far in comparison to the three u.s. grids sizes.  Sending the energy from Arizona where the sun is intense all the way up to Colorado because it's overcast is incredibly inefficient.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I almost forgot...  I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.  Look into dry cask storage and you'll see what I mean.  All the fuel we've used since the plant was commissioned is stored safely on site using this dry cask storage program."

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

Hydro doesn't need to be pumped if it's only used as needed to cover fluctuations and base load. This also leaves more water available for agriculture.

Here a [research paper form 2013](https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=913633).

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

"3726",720,"Backout2allenn",14,8,472,5,0,"A. This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

I do however agree that you may need a couple of nuclear power stations to supply a decent power base, but for anything above that, renewables are enough - nobody needs coal, gas and oil to power a nation in 2019.

I disagree that gas needs to go though. There are tons of manufacturing facilities that burn natural gas with the main intention of steam generation for the process. To be more fuel efficient, you couple that process with power generation turbines to provide electricity to the grid. Unless manufacting changes (goes away or finds more efficient processes) then this type of setup is likely to not go away.

Because of the fear of nuclear plants, we do need some form of coal/gas/oil for power generation to allow for cheaper energy prices. Standard of living is directly tied to energy prices.

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."

It produces minimal waste compared to fossil and most facilities are are on-site. Modern practice promotes fuel recycling, but I'll admit its not prevalent in the US. But that is due to proliferation and regulation as well as cost.

You can make that statement if you point to key events like Chernobyl and Fukushima, but if you look at US plant design and operation, an event like that is near impossible unless there is a terror attack.

Chernobyl had a positive temperature reactivity coefficient, which means as the temperature goes up (like in a meltdown), reactivity goes up. So the hotter it gets, the faster it gets hot.

"3882",1444,"caesarfecit",15,13,38,36,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"3883",1445,"LLJKTympanic",15,13,38,25,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs. 

Agree with everything else though. As annoying as INPO can be at times, it's certainly better to have it than not."

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

Do you not know how solar panels are produced? Did you know solar and wind are classed as ""pseudo green"" in the scientific field? This is because of the toxic shit they take to produce and maintain. Edit: a better explanation of how bad solar is for the environment:

No, they aren't. [Advanced nuclear is much cheaper](https://www.innovationreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Advanced-Nuclear-Reactors-Cost-Study.pdf) than renewables **without storage**. 

I challenge you to provide a source that says a full renewable package (solar, wind, and storage) *above the break even MW generation*, since you cant just break even with renewables, is cheaper than a nuclear plant.

&gt;They can also be deployed within a couple years and investors can be paid back before a nuke plant even comes online.  

Lol No. None of that is true. Again, source. 

You know China is exporting nuclear plant construction right? Its extremely profitable for them. I don't see any money-hungry countries exporting renewable plant construction.

&gt;Im not against nuclear, but theres really no need for the fear mongering. 

Two possibilities exist: 1) this is a lie and you are against nuclear. 2) you arent informed enough to be seriously debating the subject.

Take your pick. Nearly every major scientific mind and group is advocating nuclear. From Bill Gates to the UCS. What do you have that disagrees with them?

 &gt;Theres lots of dirty energy for us to replace and the world continues to consume more of it. 

Renewables are one of those dirty energy sources. They should be kept to small-scale private endeavors. If Mr.Smith wants to solarize his house, then fine. If Google wants to solarize their HQ, then fine. The main bulk of power generation for our world should absolutely be nuclear."
"3953",1641,"ClearlyAThrowawai",15,14,1640,1,0,"Batteries arent bombs. They are flammable, sure, but they dont explode with real power - they only explode because of pressure build up, and it doesnt have much power in that release. Regardless, billions upon billions of batteries have been produced, and unprovoked battery fires are vanishingly rare outside of a chronic manufacturing defect, like the Samsung case. Modern batteries, well made, can short, be cut and crushed without serious incident in many cases.

Toxic materials in solar panel manufacture is a solvable problem, and China has put in place regulations to deal with that issue (granted that it used to be a problem, and may still be in older facilities)  and most western countries have systems in place to make sure the problem is dealt with too. It is nowhere near as damaging as you would have people believe.

Renewables currently are cheaper than the best case option in that report, and Im extremely dubious of those numbers, since most conventional nuclear is traditionally much more expensive. With regards to storage, its not necessarily very important if we compromise in the shorter term - grids can work with 50%+ renewable shares of generation if they have LNG plants around. Its not a perfect solution, but its also unrealistic to expect to be able to replace the entire grids generation with alternatives in the short term either.

Its a bit disingenuous to talk about the damaging materials used in solar panels while ignoring the same for nuclear - waste is dangerous and expensive to deal with too, not to mention uranium mining.

Renewables produce more than it costs to make them. Youd think that would be evident, given that they are so cheap, often paying off in a few years, but apparently it is possible to believe the opposite. A solar panel produces its cost in energy in 2 years.

&amp;#x200B;

The big problem with solar in my opinion is just the storage aspect.  Batteries are silly levels of inefficient and have absolutely zero chance to scale to meet the needs of a grid affordably.  There are other options that have been considered, but again those get expensive fast.  If solar panels are able to reduce the load that air conditioning has in peak heat during summer I'm all for that at least, but carbon and nuclear power are far more cheap comparatively.  If I had to take my pick it'd be nuclear all the way.  The nuclear waste really isn't all that hard to manage, and if we could remove the legislative and regulatory roadblocks around nuclear power it would actually give us a path to carbon neutrality in a reasonable time frame with tech that currently exists.

There are options to meeting grid battery requirements. Most grids could get by on less than a day of battery storage, and a lot less then that on average. Also, its easy to forget that despite solar being the poster child for renewable, wind is by and large a much more significant contributor, right now at least, and it supplies power whenever the wind blows. If you have enough overlap and generation, having large batteries becomes increasingly less important. I recall an AEMO (Australian Electric Market Operator) report which cited something like 50% renewable with no storage, and 6 hours of backup meeting most needs.

There are also proposals to make use of the coming boom in electric cars - they often have batteries they would easily meet days of use for the average person, and if systems are worked out to allow them to be used as a power source when needed it could kill two birds with one stone - reduce grid battery requirements and increase incentives for electric cars.

Most (97%+) solar panels don't have toxic metals whatsoever. You're confusing CdTe solar panels which were big in the 90s with CSi panels which are just about all of the market today. Solar panels can last up to 40 years no problem.

Solar panel and wind energy payback is now less than 2 years. Again, this number was higher than 10-15 years in the 90s. This means that even if they were built on 100% fossil fuels, they'll generate at least 10x more clean energy.

There have been no utility scale battery accidents, let alone explosions. There are also commercially available, economic battery configurations such as LiFePo4 and iron-salt that are non-toxic, not flammable, not explosive, and have much longer lifespans than Li-ion.

There's no such thing as a ""nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house"". Nuclear today needs to be massive to be economically viable and incredibly regulated to prohibit nuclear weapons development. There is technology being developed that could allow nuclear to scale down. But then again there's also technology that could allow solar to be beamed down from space 24/7 (point being, let's stick to reality).

There are solar+storage projects today that are cheaper than new nuclear. Solar+storage has been decreasing  in price by 10% year over year while nuclear keeps getting more expensive (blame red tape, regulation, a contracting industry, whatever. Still less competitive each year).

Renewables by definition have no fuel cost, which means most of their cost is in CAPEX. Nuclear has tremendous capex and opex. If it didn't, they wouldn't be shutting them down.

Nuclear could be the future in 2 or 3 generations of improvements to the technology. Today it is completely dead as it is expensive to build, operate, and there doesn't seem any indication of it getting better. All the while renewables are constantly getting cheaper and making it harder for nuclear to catch up.

That's fair enough for your average person chatting shit on Reddit, but people who work 'with electricity' then try to argue from a position of authority and often hilariously wrong. Just as an example, I had a conversation with a grid engineer the other day in work and all his assumptions were way off, he used a capacity factor of 20% for wind, whereas in reality, offshore wind is now hitting 50-60%. His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps. Surplus renewables will then be put to work creating syn-gas/hydrogen or some other derivative to feed into the gas network. Last paragraph is just my opinion, rest is as factual as I could make it."

* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

You know why no company wants to build new nuclear power plants? Because they don't want to spend all the money they made within 30+ years to go towards destroying the plant safely and taking care of the radiating trash for a couple of centuries."

You're first three sentences are fine, but these plants are not old, not falling apart, and not producing anymore waste compared to other sources of energy. They were built to run for 60 years and they should all achieve that, with most of the plants going over past the design base and running for 80 years.  There is so much oversight from the NRC to Exelon/s own oversight that broken stuff just doesn't go unnoticed. I'm also guessing your'e thinking of other political parties that want to shut down nuclear because Illinois is fine with it, half of the electricity illinois produced comes from nuclear power. You also must have missed where the state lawmakers passed a law to help out Quad/Clinton compete against power producers. The thing about Dresden is bs too, if you lose primary containment, you shut down now. There is no rely on secondary containment, you shut down and fix it. "

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process.

I do however agree that you may need a couple of nuclear power stations to supply a decent power base, but for anything above that, renewables are enough - nobody needs coal, gas and oil to power a nation in 2019.

I disagree that gas needs to go though. There are tons of manufacturing facilities that burn natural gas with the main intention of steam generation for the process. To be more fuel efficient, you couple that process with power generation turbines to provide electricity to the grid. Unless manufacting changes (goes away or finds more efficient processes) then this type of setup is likely to not go away.

Because of the fear of nuclear plants, we do need some form of coal/gas/oil for power generation to allow for cheaper energy prices. Standard of living is directly tied to energy prices.

"4249",1802,"hamsterlickinggood",16,16,136,20,0,"I don't know why people think pot taxes are some magical infinite revenue source. 

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs. 

Agree with everything else though. As annoying as INPO can be at times, it's certainly better to have it than not."
"4329",1445,"caesarfecit",16,13,38,38,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case.

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

Most (97%+) solar panels don't have toxic metals whatsoever. You're confusing CdTe solar panels which were big in the 90s with CSi panels which are just about all of the market today. Solar panels can last up to 40 years no problem.

Solar panel and wind energy payback is now less than 2 years. Again, this number was higher than 10-15 years in the 90s. This means that even if they were built on 100% fossil fuels, they'll generate at least 10x more clean energy.

There have been no utility scale battery accidents, let alone explosions. There are also commercially available, economic battery configurations such as LiFePo4 and iron-salt that are non-toxic, not flammable, not explosive, and have much longer lifespans than Li-ion.

There's no such thing as a ""nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house"". Nuclear today needs to be massive to be economically viable and incredibly regulated to prohibit nuclear weapons development. There is technology being developed that could allow nuclear to scale down. But then again there's also technology that could allow solar to be beamed down from space 24/7 (point being, let's stick to reality).

There are solar+storage projects today that are cheaper than new nuclear. Solar+storage has been decreasing  in price by 10% year over year while nuclear keeps getting more expensive (blame red tape, regulation, a contracting industry, whatever. Still less competitive each year).

Renewables by definition have no fuel cost, which means most of their cost is in CAPEX. Nuclear has tremendous capex and opex. If it didn't, they wouldn't be shutting them down.

Nuclear could be the future in 2 or 3 generations of improvements to the technology. Today it is completely dead as it is expensive to build, operate, and there doesn't seem any indication of it getting better. All the while renewables are constantly getting cheaper and making it harder for nuclear to catch up.

Just as an example, I had a conversation with a grid engineer the other day in work and all his assumptions were way off, he used a capacity factor of 20% for wind, whereas in reality, offshore wind is now hitting 50-60%. His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps. Surplus renewables will then be put to work creating syn-gas/hydrogen or some other derivative to feed into the gas network. Last paragraph is just my opinion, rest is as factual as I could make it."

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

Hydro doesn't need to be pumped if it's only used as needed to cover fluctuations and base load. This also leaves more water available for agriculture.

If we accept the erroneous premise of these comments that Chicago is giving up nuclear energy to move to wind and solar then we can see that even if those two latter sources had the ability to supply the city (and they don't), the city would still increase its greenhouse gas emissions.

As we get close to 60-70% renewables (the current easy-to-manage limit), decide whether it's worth building current generation nuclear at its overinflated cost or deploy cheaper/better advanced nukes if they're cheap enough.

Chicago can be considered the nuclear city because the [Chicago Pile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1), the first controllable nuclear reactor, was located under Stagg Field at the University of Chicago.  It is fortunate that the city later had a number of nuclear reactors constructed around it as that undoubtedly saved untold thousands of lives.

Here a [research paper form 2013](https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=913633).

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

"4603",742,"Backout2allenn",16,8,741,5,0,"A. This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

Sure Chicago proper is 2.7 million but Chicago Metro makes up 9.5 million and all of Illinois has 12.8 million. 

Sure we could ignore the rest of the state (as everyone in Chicago does) but the metro population spends a great deal of time in the CBD being made up of suburb after suburb of daily commuters. This also doesnt account for the high tourist rate the city sees (approx 50 million per year) although it appears Colorado sees high numbers as well (Id argue this would decline as legalization spreads.  A good deal of pot sold illegally in Illinois comes for CO and CA, at least where I grew up in IL that was the case). 

Either way I agree to an extent that a marijuana tax is used as a scape goat for Illinois politicians. In my opinion they need to get rid of their flat income tax. It kills the middle class in the state. 

All that said, if using it as a scape goat gets it legal already, then have at it hoss.

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems. It's just to me we need at least one more wave of new plants to keep us with green energy until renewables and battery tech catch up enough to actually manage to work as base load for the nation.

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."

Chernobyl was a cluster fuck of problems waiting to happen, from a fundamentally flawed reactor design, to a testing protocol that just begged to trigger said design flaw, to operators who weren't aware of said flaw, and the fact that the Soviets had no idea how to clean up a disaster like that, leading to unnecessary deaths.

And Fukushima was 40 year old badly maintained technology with a flawed plant design (underground backup power on a coastal site on a fault line = facepalm) and a foreseeable natural disaster.

One of the biggest problems with nuclear power is the fact that we're not building more, which means obsolete designs are staying in service longer than they should. "

"4767",1444,"caesarfecit",17,13,38,41,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"4768",1445,"SadZealot",17,13,38,19,0,"Instrumentation failed, bad emergency response training, but the failure that did occur ultimately caused no harm to anyone"
"4769",1447,"LLJKTympanic",17,13,38,25,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs. 

Agree with everything else though. As annoying as INPO can be at times, it's certainly better to have it than not."

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

Most (97%+) solar panels don't have toxic metals whatsoever. You're confusing CdTe solar panels which were big in the 90s with CSi panels which are just about all of the market today. Solar panels can last up to 40 years no problem.

Solar panel and wind energy payback is now less than 2 years. Again, this number was higher than 10-15 years in the 90s. This means that even if they were built on 100% fossil fuels, they'll generate at least 10x more clean energy.

There have been no utility scale battery accidents, let alone explosions. There are also commercially available, economic battery configurations such as LiFePo4 and iron-salt that are non-toxic, not flammable, not explosive, and have much longer lifespans than Li-ion.

There's no such thing as a ""nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house"". Nuclear today needs to be massive to be economically viable and incredibly regulated to prohibit nuclear weapons development. There is technology being developed that could allow nuclear to scale down. But then again there's also technology that could allow solar to be beamed down from space 24/7 (point being, let's stick to reality).

There are solar+storage projects today that are cheaper than new nuclear. Solar+storage has been decreasing  in price by 10% year over year while nuclear keeps getting more expensive (blame red tape, regulation, a contracting industry, whatever. Still less competitive each year).

Renewables by definition have no fuel cost, which means most of their cost is in CAPEX. Nuclear has tremendous capex and opex. If it didn't, they wouldn't be shutting them down.

Nuclear could be the future in 2 or 3 generations of improvements to the technology. Today it is completely dead as it is expensive to build, operate, and there doesn't seem any indication of it getting better. All the while renewables are constantly getting cheaper and making it harder for nuclear to catch up.

Someone working on the grid would have an especially good perspective on the overall anticipated costs of electricity and whether any given source would be able to stack up to it, as well as understanding exactly how much money would need to be invested into renewables in order to meet those needs (during the day...because panels only work less than half the time)."

That's fair enough for your average person chatting shit on Reddit, but people who work 'with electricity' then try to argue from a position of authority and often hilariously wrong. Just as an example, I had a conversation with a grid engineer the other day in work and all his assumptions were way off, he used a capacity factor of 20% for wind, whereas in reality, offshore wind is now hitting 50-60%. His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps. Surplus renewables will then be put to work creating syn-gas/hydrogen or some other derivative to feed into the gas network. Last paragraph is just my opinion, rest is as factual as I could make it."

One think people don't know about nuclear is the decommissioning cost which are always extremely high and long which makes decommissioning cost that much harder to predict and nuclear waste is a nightmare to deal with. Not taking sides here just spitting some facts. I think an ideal energy plan make  use of solar/wind and nuclear plus others. I think is a very hot topic and people can get pretty emotional.

* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.

Hopefully storage.  But you're probably right and we're probably back to bullet #2, which is unfortunate.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "

So does that mean your point is ""we should tolerate unsafe nuclear reactors now because they'll be better in the future""? Because I hope that's not your point. There's a big difference between a steam engine and a nuclear reactor. (Even though a nuclear reactor *is* just a steam engine, when you get right down to it.) If a steam engine blows up it just kills the people nearby. No one should be willing to build an unsafe nuclear reactor at any point--even if it will help make them safer in the future.

The grid may be connected across a pretty large distance but power isn't really sent that far in comparison to the three u.s. grids sizes.  Sending the energy from Arizona where the sun is intense all the way up to Colorado because it's overcast is incredibly inefficient.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I almost forgot...  I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.  Look into dry cask storage and you'll see what I mean.  All the fuel we've used since the plant was commissioned is stored safely on site using this dry cask storage program."

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

Hydro doesn't need to be pumped if it's only used as needed to cover fluctuations and base load. This also leaves more water available for agriculture.

Here a [research paper form 2013](https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=913633).

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

"5024",742,"Backout2allenn",17,8,741,3,0,"A. This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

There's not enough money in pot taxes to eliminate fossil fuel power plants or provide health insurance to all the uninsured or *any* of these ""just use the marijuana money"" comments I see on Reddit."

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

Sure Chicago proper is 2.7 million but Chicago Metro makes up 9.5 million and all of Illinois has 12.8 million. 

Sure we could ignore the rest of the state (as everyone in Chicago does) but the metro population spends a great deal of time in the CBD being made up of suburb after suburb of daily commuters. This also doesnt account for the high tourist rate the city sees (approx 50 million per year) although it appears Colorado sees high numbers as well (Id argue this would decline as legalization spreads.  A good deal of pot sold illegally in Illinois comes for CO and CA, at least where I grew up in IL that was the case). 

Either way I agree to an extent that a marijuana tax is used as a scape goat for Illinois politicians. In my opinion they need to get rid of their flat income tax. It kills the middle class in the state. 

All that said, if using it as a scape goat gets it legal already, then have at it hoss. Its high time we stop locking people up and spending tax money on nonviolent offender incarceration (state spends approx 1.2 billion per year total.

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems. It's just to me we need at least one more wave of new plants to keep us with green energy until renewables and battery tech catch up enough to actually manage to work as base load for the nation.

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.

"5185",1444,"caesarfecit",18,13,38,43,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "

They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs.

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

Lol No. None of that is true. Again, source. 

You know China is exporting nuclear plant construction right? Its extremely profitable for them. I don't see any money-hungry countries exporting renewable plant construction.

&gt;Im not against nuclear, but theres really no need for the fear mongering. 

Two possibilities exist: 1) this is a lie and you are against nuclear. 2) you arent informed enough to be seriously debating the subject.

Take your pick. Nearly every major scientific mind and group is advocating nuclear. From Bill Gates to the UCS. What do you have that disagrees with them?

 &gt;Theres lots of dirty energy for us to replace and the world continues to consume more of it. 

Renewables are one of those dirty energy sources. They should be kept to small-scale private endeavors. If Mr.Smith wants to solarize his house, then fine. If Google wants to solarize their HQ, then fine. The main bulk of power generation for our world should absolutely be nuclear."

"5250",1644,"FranciscoGalt",18,14,1638,1,0,"A reason to get rid of nuclear is that it's more costly to operate than to shut it down. It's happening all over the world. Where it's cheaper it shouldn't be shut down though.

Most (97%+) solar panels don't have toxic metals whatsoever. You're confusing CdTe solar panels which were big in the 90s with CSi panels which are just about all of the market today. Solar panels can last up to 40 years no problem.

Solar panel and wind energy payback is now less than 2 years. Again, this number was higher than 10-15 years in the 90s. This means that even if they were built on 100% fossil fuels, they'll generate at least 10x more clean energy.

There have been no utility scale battery accidents, let alone explosions. There are also commercially available, economic battery configurations such as LiFePo4 and iron-salt that are non-toxic, not flammable, not explosive, and have much longer lifespans than Li-ion.

There's no such thing as a ""nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house"". Nuclear today needs to be massive to be economically viable and incredibly regulated to prohibit nuclear weapons development. There is technology being developed that could allow nuclear to scale down. But then again there's also technology that could allow solar to be beamed down from space 24/7 (point being, let's stick to reality).

There are solar+storage projects today that are cheaper than new nuclear. Solar+storage has been decreasing  in price by 10% year over year while nuclear keeps getting more expensive (blame red tape, regulation, a contracting industry, whatever. Still less competitive each year).

Renewables by definition have no fuel cost, which means most of their cost is in CAPEX. Nuclear has tremendous capex and opex. If it didn't, they wouldn't be shutting them down.

Nuclear could be the future in 2 or 3 generations of improvements to the technology. Today it is completely dead as it is expensive to build, operate, and there doesn't seem any indication of it getting better. All the while renewables are constantly getting cheaper and making it harder for nuclear to catch up. [Even France, the world leader in renewables is shutting down plants.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thelocal.fr/20181127/france-to-close-14-nuclear-reactors-by-2035/amp)

Just as an example, I had a conversation with a grid engineer the other day in work and all his assumptions were way off, he used a capacity factor of 20% for wind, whereas in reality, offshore wind is now hitting 50-60%. His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps. Surplus renewables will then be put to work creating syn-gas/hydrogen or some other derivative to feed into the gas network. Last paragraph is just my opinion, rest is as factual as I could make it."

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "

There's a big difference between a steam engine and a nuclear reactor. (Even though a nuclear reactor *is* just a steam engine, when you get right down to it.) If a steam engine blows up it just kills the people nearby. No one should be willing to build an unsafe nuclear reactor at any point--even if it will help make them safer in the future.

The grid may be connected across a pretty large distance but power isn't really sent that far in comparison to the three u.s. grids sizes.  Sending the energy from Arizona where the sun is intense all the way up to Colorado because it's overcast is incredibly inefficient.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I almost forgot...  I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.

Nuclear takes too long to build, costs too much up front, and carries too much risk (of being unprofitable due to changing economics, cost overruns, construction delays, etc.  The risk from radioactive material release is very small, but the risk of going bankrupt trying to run a nuclear energy company is huge.)

Nuclear is great in concept but if the target is 2035 then it's a non-starter, it just takes too long to build and commission and nobody wants to take on the financial risk to build new reactors in the private market.  We would have to have a government-run nuclear energy company that built reactors with public funds paid for by a tax on the people to make it actually work, and that's fundamentally opposed to the country's capitalist republic nature.

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

Hydro doesn't need to be pumped if it's only used as needed to cover fluctuations and base load. This also leaves more water available for agriculture.

If we accept the erroneous premise of these comments that Chicago is giving up nuclear energy to move to wind and solar then we can see that even if those two latter sources had the ability to supply the city (and they don't), the city would still increase its greenhouse gas emissions.

Here a [research paper form 2013](https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=913633).

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

Until that is resolved, the dynamic will be that nuclear competes with coal for baseline power, and renewables will compete with shale gas.  [Even baseline power production benefits from high capacity storage technology.  Meanwhile, getting around the duck-curve problem with renewables absolutely revolves around the development of affordable, maintainable, extensible storage solutions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DydH3UUwR90)  Without that, renewables struggle merely to offset use of shale gas at peaker plants, and mainly during off peak hours.

If we want to resolve the problem and spend money, throw money at storage material research.  With expandable, reliable battery tech in place, we can use renewables to vastly diminish use of peaker plants, and even to allow baseline plants to establish economic equilibrium with renewables.  They give us an economic excuse to build out solar and wind beyond immediate use capacity.  Then it makes sense to start pushing subsidies for storage rollouts.  Energy companies not involved in renewables also have incentive to spend money in this area.

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc."
"5586",339,"realityChemist",19,7,144,1,0,"To your second point, decentralized generation is a no-go *until* significantly better battery/capacitor tech gets figured out. If you try to implement in the other order, you're going to end up with rolling brown outs as the amount of power and demand both fluctuate dramatically and in an uncorrelated way.

So saying we shouldn't invest in any new nuclear is essentially a gamble that we'll figure the storage problem out before the demand for non-CO2-emitting generation reaches the point where we would have preferred having those nuclear plants.

"5596",555,"slipstream808",19,8,4,8,1,"Economically not feasible.  They take way to long to build and too much money.  In this timeframe you end up with cost overruns and delays in schedule.  Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."

And Fukushima was 40 year old badly maintained technology with a flawed plant design (underground backup power on a coastal site on a fault line = facepalm) and a foreseeable natural disaster.

"5613",1444,"caesarfecit",19,13,38,36,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"5614",1445,"SadZealot",19,13,38,18,0,"Instrumentation failed, bad emergency response training, but the failure that did occur ultimately caused no harm to anyone"
"5615",1447,"LLJKTympanic",19,13,38,26,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs.

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

Do you know how batteries work? Do you remember how a 1mm tolerance error caused an entire line of phones to be recalled since they exploded? Those batteries were the size of business cards. Imagine a *facility full of industrial size batteries*. 

Batteries store energy. Energy is volatile. More energy density in one place means more volatility. Do you need a scientific source for this, or are current events and common knowledge enough?

Do you not know how solar panels are produced? Did you know solar and wind are classed as ""pseudo green"" in the scientific field? This is because of the toxic shit they take to produce and maintain. Edit: a better explanation of how bad solar is for the environment:

No, they aren't. [Advanced nuclear is much cheaper](https://www.innovationreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Advanced-Nuclear-Reactors-Cost-Study.pdf) than renewables **without storage**. 

I challenge you to provide a source that says a full renewable package (solar, wind, and storage) *above the break even MW generation*, since you cant just break even with renewables, is cheaper than a nuclear plant.

&gt;They can also be deployed within a couple years and investors can be paid back before a nuke plant even comes online.  

Lol No. None of that is true. Again, source. 

You know China is exporting nuclear plant construction right? Its extremely profitable for them. I don't see any money-hungry countries exporting renewable plant construction.

 &gt;Theres lots of dirty energy for us to replace and the world continues to consume more of it.

Most (97%+) solar panels don't have toxic metals whatsoever. You're confusing CdTe solar panels which were big in the 90s with CSi panels which are just about all of the market today. Solar panels can last up to 40 years no problem.

Solar panel and wind energy payback is now less than 2 years. Again, this number was higher than 10-15 years in the 90s. This means that even if they were built on 100% fossil fuels, they'll generate at least 10x more clean energy.

There have been no utility scale battery accidents, let alone explosions. There are also commercially available, economic battery configurations such as LiFePo4 and iron-salt that are non-toxic, not flammable, not explosive, and have much longer lifespans than Li-ion.

There's no such thing as a ""nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house"". Nuclear today needs to be massive to be economically viable and incredibly regulated to prohibit nuclear weapons development. There is technology being developed that could allow nuclear to scale down. But then again there's also technology that could allow solar to be beamed down from space 24/7 (point being, let's stick to reality).

There are solar+storage projects today that are cheaper than new nuclear. Solar+storage has been decreasing  in price by 10% year over year while nuclear keeps getting more expensive (blame red tape, regulation, a contracting industry, whatever. Still less competitive each year).

Renewables by definition have no fuel cost, which means most of their cost is in CAPEX. Nuclear has tremendous capex and opex. If it didn't, they wouldn't be shutting them down.

Nuclear could be the future in 2 or 3 generations of improvements to the technology. Today it is completely dead as it is expensive to build, operate, and there doesn't seem any indication of it getting better. All the while renewables are constantly getting cheaper and making it harder for nuclear to catch up.

That's fair enough for your average person chatting shit on Reddit, but people who work 'with electricity' then try to argue from a position of authority and often hilariously wrong. Just as an example, I had a conversation with a grid engineer the other day in work and all his assumptions were way off, he used a capacity factor of 20% for wind, whereas in reality, offshore wind is now hitting 50-60%. His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps. Surplus renewables will then be put to work creating syn-gas/hydrogen or some other derivative to feed into the gas network. Last paragraph is just my opinion, rest is as factual as I could make it."

* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.

Hopefully storage.  But you're probably right and we're probably back to bullet #2, which is unfortunate.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.

If we accept the erroneous premise of these comments that Chicago is giving up nuclear energy to move to wind and solar then we can see that even if those two latter sources had the ability to supply the city (and they don't), the city would still increase its greenhouse gas emissions.

Here a [research paper form 2013](https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=913633).

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

I only have 3 issues with nuclear power and none of them are radiation getting out and creating flipper babies or Godzillas:

1. They are expensive as hell and take forever to build. 

2. Theyre permanent, and I dont mean like, theyll be there for a long time permanent. I mean that even after theyre turned off, theyre still there with people monitoring them making sure that they dont melt down for generations. Theyll be the medieval cathedrals that we leave future generations. 

3. The nuclear waste. With newer technology, this is getting mitigated to smaller and less potent amounts, but its still something that we have to deal with.

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems. It's just to me we need at least one more wave of new plants to keep us with green energy until renewables and battery tech catch up enough to actually manage to work as base load for the nation. (or fusion gets figured out). "
"5993",2042,"onequarterbritish",20,19,13,2,0,"Your points are somewhat valid, but there's some room for accuracy and context.

1. They're expensive, but this is partly due to regulation. Most often nuclear power plants are given permits by the unit, which means that it makes sense to build the biggest unit possible at once to reduce the load from bureaucracy and politics. Smaller, modular power plants would have smaller upfront costs and shorter build times, and the capacity could be increased over time by starting with small capacity, which allows them to start turning profit sooner. Overall nuclear power plants aren't really expensive in the sense that eventually they'll turn out to be very profitable, but it often takes time due to the large size of the plants since from regulation point of view there's little difference between building 10 large plants or 10 small plants. If the regulation changes, this could change too.

For 2. and 3., there's really no need to monitor the plants after decommission. There's waste that needs to be cared for, but when compared to all the other waste production by humankind, nuclear waste is perhaps the least of our worries. Importantly, the waste is extremely dense so volume-wise it's very compact. All of the nuclear waste from spent fuel since the 1950's would fit inside a single football field. Furthermore, there are reactor designs that can reuse spent fuel up to a degree, reducing the amount of final waste further. However, due to being quite a stigmatized field, as well as uranium simply being cheap, there's been little investments towards this technology and its commercialization."

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc."
"6015",148,"realityChemist",20,6,147,3,0,"To your second point, decentralized generation is a no-go *until* significantly better battery/capacitor tech gets figured out. If you try to implement in the other order, you're going to end up with rolling brown outs as the amount of power and demand both fluctuate dramatically and in an uncorrelated way.

So saying we shouldn't invest in any new nuclear is essentially a gamble that we'll figure the storage problem out before the demand for non-CO2-emitting generation reaches the point where we would have preferred having those nuclear plants. As someone who's spent several years working in advanced electronic materials, and given the current state of the environment, I'm not sure that's a gamble I'd take.

"6022",555,"slipstream808",20,8,4,11,1,"Economically not feasible.  They take way to long to build and too much money.  In this timeframe you end up with cost overruns and delays in schedule.  Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."

And Fukushima was 40 year old badly maintained technology with a flawed plant design (underground backup power on a coastal site on a fault line = facepalm) and a foreseeable natural disaster.

"6038",1444,"caesarfecit",20,13,38,37,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs.

Like a lot of groups, there are hard divides within. You have pro and anti nuclear within ""the movement"" so to speak.

The only problem with nuclear is how expensive it is to do properly - including building and then decommissioning reactors safely. Hinkly C is on track to be one (if not the) most expensive power plants of any type to be built."
"6075",155,"MrPopanz",20,6,154,4,0,"&gt;The only problem with nuclear is how expensive it is to do properly

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

Just as an example, I had a conversation with a grid engineer the other day in work and all his assumptions were way off, he used a capacity factor of 20% for wind, whereas in reality, offshore wind is now hitting 50-60%. His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps. Surplus renewables will then be put to work creating syn-gas/hydrogen or some other derivative to feed into the gas network. Last paragraph is just my opinion, rest is as factual as I could make it."

* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

Nuclear is great in concept but if the target is 2035 then it's a non-starter, it just takes too long to build and commission and nobody wants to take on the financial risk to build new reactors in the private market.

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

Hydro doesn't need to be pumped if it's only used as needed to cover fluctuations and base load. This also leaves more water available for agriculture.

There is so much oversight from the NRC to Exelon/s own oversight that broken stuff just doesn't go unnoticed. I'm also guessing your'e thinking of other political parties that want to shut down nuclear because Illinois is fine with it, half of the electricity illinois produced comes from nuclear power.

If we accept the erroneous premise of these comments that Chicago is giving up nuclear energy to move to wind and solar then we can see that even if those two latter sources had the ability to supply the city (and they don't), the city would still increase its greenhouse gas emissions.

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

"6303",742,"Backout2allenn",20,8,741,3,0,"A. This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems. It's just to me we need at least one more wave of new plants to keep us with green energy until renewables and battery tech catch up enough to actually manage to work as base load for the nation. (or fusion gets figured out). "
"6422",2042,"onequarterbritish",21,19,13,2,0,"Your points are somewhat valid, but there's some room for accuracy and context.

1. They're expensive, but this is partly due to regulation. Most often nuclear power plants are given permits by the unit, which means that it makes sense to build the biggest unit possible at once to reduce the load from bureaucracy and politics. Smaller, modular power plants would have smaller upfront costs and shorter build times, and the capacity could be increased over time by starting with small capacity, which allows them to start turning profit sooner. Overall nuclear power plants aren't really expensive in the sense that eventually they'll turn out to be very profitable, but it often takes time due to the large size of the plants since from regulation point of view there's little difference between building 10 large plants or 10 small plants. If the regulation changes, this could change too.

For 2. and 3., there's really no need to monitor the plants after decommission. There's waste that needs to be cared for, but when compared to all the other waste production by humankind, nuclear waste is perhaps the least of our worries. Importantly, the waste is extremely dense so volume-wise it's very compact. All of the nuclear waste from spent fuel since the 1950's would fit inside a single football field. Furthermore, there are reactor designs that can reuse spent fuel up to a degree, reducing the amount of final waste further. However, due to being quite a stigmatized field, as well as uranium simply being cheap, there's been little investments towards this technology and its commercialization."
"6423",2050,"WorBlux",21,20,13,2,0,"1. For current gen reactors in western nations where labor is expensive, this is quite true.  It's not necessarily true of potential future designs.  I think the money is a lot better spent in r+d, and regulatory reform than trying to build  more PWR reactors. "

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc."

If you try to implement in the other order, you're going to end up with rolling brown outs as the amount of power and demand both fluctuate dramatically and in an uncorrelated way.

So saying we shouldn't invest in any new nuclear is essentially a gamble that we'll figure the storage problem out before the demand for non-CO2-emitting generation reaches the point where we would have preferred having those nuclear plants. As someone who's spent several years working in advanced electronic materials, and given the current state of the environment, I'm not sure that's a gamble I'd take.

Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.

"6470",2086,"caesarfecit",21,21,1449,39,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case.

"6471",2087,"LLJKTympanic",21,21,1449,25,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  
&gt;
&gt;TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 
&gt;

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs. 

Agree with everything else though. As annoying as INPO can be at times, it's certainly better to have it than not."

The only problem with nuclear is how expensive it is to do properly - including building and then decommissioning reactors safely. Hinkly C is on track to be one (if not the) most expensive power plants of any type to be built."
"6506",155,"MrPopanz",21,6,154,5,0,"&gt;The only problem with nuclear is how expensive it is to do properly

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps. Surplus renewables will then be put to work creating syn-gas/hydrogen or some other derivative to feed into the gas network. Last paragraph is just my opinion, rest is as factual as I could make it."

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Telling people that ""green won't work"" isn't going to make nuclear happen, it's just going to make coal and natural gas happen.  It's counter-productive.  Nuclear takes too long to build, costs too much up front, and carries too much risk (of being unprofitable due to changing economics, cost overruns, construction delays, etc.  The risk from radioactive material release is very small, but the risk of going bankrupt trying to run a nuclear energy company is huge.)

Nuclear is great in concept but if the target is 2035 then it's a non-starter, it just takes too long to build and commission and nobody wants to take on the financial risk to build new reactors in the private market.  We would have to have a government-run nuclear energy company that built reactors with public funds paid for by a tax on the people to make it actually work, and that's fundamentally opposed to the country's capitalist republic nature.

&gt; Solar/wind will be important components of a future grid makeup, but due to their variability they cannot supply the whole grid, at least until there is a viable storage method available.

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

Hydro doesn't need to be pumped if it's only used as needed to cover fluctuations and base load. This also leaves more water available for agriculture.

If we accept the erroneous premise of these comments that Chicago is giving up nuclear energy to move to wind and solar then we can see that even if those two latter sources had the ability to supply the city (and they don't), the city would still increase its greenhouse gas emissions.

Chicago can be considered the nuclear city because the [Chicago Pile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1), the first controllable nuclear reactor, was located under Stagg Field at the University of Chicago.  It is fortunate that the city later had a number of nuclear reactors constructed around it as that undoubtedly saved untold thousands of lives.

Here a [research paper form 2013](https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=913633).

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

"6734",742,"Backout2allenn",21,8,741,4,0,"A. This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

There's not enough money in pot taxes to eliminate fossil fuel power plants or provide health insurance to all the uninsured or *any* of these ""just use the marijuana money"" comments I see on Reddit."

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

1. They are expensive as hell and take forever to build.

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems. It's just to me we need at least one more wave of new plants to keep us with green energy until renewables and battery tech catch up enough to actually manage to work as base load for the nation. (or fusion gets figured out). "
"6853",2042,"onequarterbritish",22,19,13,2,0,"Your points are somewhat valid, but there's some room for accuracy and context.

1. They're expensive, but this is partly due to regulation. Most often nuclear power plants are given permits by the unit, which means that it makes sense to build the biggest unit possible at once to reduce the load from bureaucracy and politics. Smaller, modular power plants would have smaller upfront costs and shorter build times, and the capacity could be increased over time by starting with small capacity, which allows them to start turning profit sooner. Overall nuclear power plants aren't really expensive in the sense that eventually they'll turn out to be very profitable, but it often takes time due to the large size of the plants since from regulation point of view there's little difference between building 10 large plants or 10 small plants. If the regulation changes, this could change too.

For 2. and 3., there's really no need to monitor the plants after decommission. There's waste that needs to be cared for, but when compared to all the other waste production by humankind, nuclear waste is perhaps the least of our worries. Importantly, the waste is extremely dense so volume-wise it's very compact. All of the nuclear waste from spent fuel since the 1950's would fit inside a single football field. Furthermore, there are reactor designs that can reuse spent fuel up to a degree, reducing the amount of final waste further. However, due to being quite a stigmatized field, as well as uranium simply being cheap, there's been little investments towards this technology and its commercialization."
"6854",2050,"WorBlux",22,20,13,2,0,"1. For current gen reactors in western nations where labor is expensive, this is quite true.  It's not necessarily true of potential future designs.  I think the money is a lot better spent in r+d, and regulatory reform than trying to build  more PWR reactors. "

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc."
"6875",148,"realityChemist",22,6,147,5,0,"To your second point, decentralized generation is a no-go *until* significantly better battery/capacitor tech gets figured out. If you try to implement in the other order, you're going to end up with rolling brown outs as the amount of power and demand both fluctuate dramatically and in an uncorrelated way.

So saying we shouldn't invest in any new nuclear is essentially a gamble that we'll figure the storage problem out before the demand for non-CO2-emitting generation reaches the point where we would have preferred having those nuclear plants. As someone who's spent several years working in advanced electronic materials, and given the current state of the environment, I'm not sure that's a gamble I'd take.

Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.

And Fukushima was 40 year old badly maintained technology with a flawed plant design (underground backup power on a coastal site on a fault line = facepalm) and a foreseeable natural disaster.

"6901",2086,"caesarfecit",22,21,1449,40,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"6902",2087,"LLJKTympanic",22,21,1449,28,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

&gt;

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs. 

Agree with everything else though. As annoying as INPO can be at times, it's certainly better to have it than not."

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

Do you know how batteries work? Do you remember how a 1mm tolerance error caused an entire line of phones to be recalled since they exploded? Those batteries were the size of business cards. Imagine a *facility full of industrial size batteries*. 

Batteries store energy. Energy is volatile. More energy density in one place means more volatility. Do you need a scientific source for this, or are current events and common knowledge enough?

Do you not know how solar panels are produced? Did you know solar and wind are classed as ""pseudo green"" in the scientific field? This is because of the toxic shit they take to produce and maintain. Edit: a better explanation of how bad solar is for the environment:

No, they aren't. [Advanced nuclear is much cheaper](https://www.innovationreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Advanced-Nuclear-Reactors-Cost-Study.pdf) than renewables **without storage**. 

I challenge you to provide a source that says a full renewable package (solar, wind, and storage) *above the break even MW generation*, since you cant just break even with renewables, is cheaper than a nuclear plant.

Just as an example, I had a conversation with a grid engineer the other day in work and all his assumptions were way off, he used a capacity factor of 20% for wind, whereas in reality, offshore wind is now hitting 50-60%. His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps. Surplus renewables will then be put to work creating syn-gas/hydrogen or some other derivative to feed into the gas network. Last paragraph is just my opinion, rest is as factual as I could make it."

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "
"7053",1671,"filbert227",22,14,856,3,0,"The problem is baseload is a lot more complex than just sending power from one region to another.  The grid may be connected across a pretty large distance but power isn't really sent that far in comparison to the three u.s. grids sizes.  Sending the energy from Arizona where the sun is intense all the way up to Colorado because it's overcast is incredibly inefficient.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I almost forgot...  I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.  Look into dry cask storage and you'll see what I mean.  All the fuel we've used since the plant was commissioned is stored safely on site using this dry cask storage program."

Telling people that ""green won't work"" isn't going to make nuclear happen, it's just going to make coal and natural gas happen.  It's counter-productive.  Nuclear takes too long to build, costs too much up front, and carries too much risk (of being unprofitable due to changing economics, cost overruns, construction delays, etc.  The risk from radioactive material release is very small, but the risk of going bankrupt trying to run a nuclear energy company is huge.)

Nuclear is great in concept but if the target is 2035 then it's a non-starter, it just takes too long to build and commission and nobody wants to take on the financial risk to build new reactors in the private market.  We would have to have a government-run nuclear energy company that built reactors with public funds paid for by a tax on the people to make it actually work, and that's fundamentally opposed to the country's capitalist republic nature.

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

Hydro doesn't need to be pumped if it's only used as needed to cover fluctuations and base load. This also leaves more water available for agriculture.

If we accept the erroneous premise of these comments that Chicago is giving up nuclear energy to move to wind and solar then we can see that even if those two latter sources had the ability to supply the city (and they don't), the city would still increase its greenhouse gas emissions.  But because wind and solar are subject to intermittent failures the city will be buying energy from much more carbon intensive sources.  Chicago's emissions will go up thanks to this decision."

Here a [research paper form 2013](https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=913633).

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

"7165",742,"Backout2allenn",22,8,741,4,0,"A. This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition).

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems. It's just to me we need at least one more wave of new plants to keep us with green energy until renewables and battery tech catch up enough to actually manage to work as base load for the nation. (or fusion gets figured out). "
"7284",2042,"onequarterbritish",23,19,13,2,0,"Your points are somewhat valid, but there's some room for accuracy and context.

1. They're expensive, but this is partly due to regulation. Most often nuclear power plants are given permits by the unit, which means that it makes sense to build the biggest unit possible at once to reduce the load from bureaucracy and politics. Smaller, modular power plants would have smaller upfront costs and shorter build times, and the capacity could be increased over time by starting with small capacity, which allows them to start turning profit sooner. Overall nuclear power plants aren't really expensive in the sense that eventually they'll turn out to be very profitable, but it often takes time due to the large size of the plants since from regulation point of view there's little difference between building 10 large plants or 10 small plants. If the regulation changes, this could change too.

For 2. and 3., there's really no need to monitor the plants after decommission. There's waste that needs to be cared for, but when compared to all the other waste production by humankind, nuclear waste is perhaps the least of our worries. Importantly, the waste is extremely dense so volume-wise it's very compact. All of the nuclear waste from spent fuel since the 1950's would fit inside a single football field. Furthermore, there are reactor designs that can reuse spent fuel up to a degree, reducing the amount of final waste further. However, due to being quite a stigmatized field, as well as uranium simply being cheap, there's been little investments towards this technology and its commercialization."

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc."

So saying we shouldn't invest in any new nuclear is essentially a gamble that we'll figure the storage problem out before the demand for non-CO2-emitting generation reaches the point where we would have preferred having those nuclear plants.

"7314",555,"slipstream808",23,8,4,11,1,"Economically not feasible.  They take way to long to build and too much money.  In this timeframe you end up with cost overruns and delays in schedule.  Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."

And Fukushima was 40 year old badly maintained technology with a flawed plant design (underground backup power on a coastal site on a fault line = facepalm) and a foreseeable natural disaster.

"7330",2086,"caesarfecit",23,21,1449,40,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"7331",2087,"LLJKTympanic",23,21,1449,26,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs. 

Agree with everything else though. As annoying as INPO can be at times, it's certainly better to have it than not."

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

That's fair enough for your average person chatting shit on Reddit, but people who work 'with electricity' then try to argue from a position of authority and often hilariously wrong. Just as an example, I had a conversation with a grid engineer the other day in work and all his assumptions were way off, he used a capacity factor of 20% for wind, whereas in reality, offshore wind is now hitting 50-60%. His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps. Surplus renewables will then be put to work creating syn-gas/hydrogen or some other derivative to feed into the gas network. Last paragraph is just my opinion, rest is as factual as I could make it."

"7461",1832,"kd8azz",23,16,1828,2,1,"(Yes, I know carbon-neutral and renewable are different things, but saying it this way gives me four bullets instead of three.)  I can think of four different definitions of carbon-neutral, when it comes to an electrical grid.

* I buy a kWh worth of carbon offsets for every kWh of electricity I use.
* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.
* Bullet #2, and the carbon-neutral electricity I'm buying is also the geographically closest electricity source, to me, so I'm probably actually using it.
* There are literally zero carbon-burning electricity sources on my grid.


&gt; This is totally impossible without disconnecting from the power grid entirely.

This argues for bullet #4, which is indeed the best.  But I'd argue bullet #3 is probably sufficient.

&gt; How do you think power is being delivered when the sun isnt shining and the wind isnt blowing?

Hopefully storage.  But you're probably right and we're probably back to bullet #2, which is unfortunate.

My house runs on bullet #2.  Bullet #3 can happen with variable pricing and a battery.  If variable pricing was available in my area, I'd buy a battery."

Storage is the ideal goal, but we are lightyears away from being able to store that much power...

The power company will charge you a premium for providing you with ""renewable energy"" while in reality, your power still comes from the same sources it did before... It's a business tactic... 

"
"7463",1834,"wolfkeeper",23,16,1832,2,0,"If I've understood you correctly, there's another carbon neutral system, where there's (say) solar connected on the grid, and it's owned by a producer, who is being paid by customers, who take their electricity from the grid and get metered in the completely normal way.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "
"7483",1671,"filbert227",23,14,856,5,0,"The problem is baseload is a lot more complex than just sending power from one region to another.  The grid may be connected across a pretty large distance but power isn't really sent that far in comparison to the three u.s. grids sizes.  Sending the energy from Arizona where the sun is intense all the way up to Colorado because it's overcast is incredibly inefficient.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I almost forgot...  I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.

Nuclear takes too long to build, costs too much up front, and carries too much risk (of being unprofitable due to changing economics, cost overruns, construction delays, etc.  The risk from radioactive material release is very small, but the risk of going bankrupt trying to run a nuclear energy company is huge.)

Nuclear is great in concept but if the target is 2035 then it's a non-starter, it just takes too long to build and commission and nobody wants to take on the financial risk to build new reactors in the private market.  We would have to have a government-run nuclear energy company that built reactors with public funds paid for by a tax on the people to make it actually work, and that's fundamentally opposed to the country's capitalist republic nature.

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

Hydro doesn't need to be pumped if it's only used as needed to cover fluctuations and base load. This also leaves more water available for agriculture.

Unless you're building double break-even MW of solar generators and double break-even of wind generators, along with at least double break-even of batteries to back it up, renewables will not hold up in regular winter weather conditions.

There is a lot less solar energy available in the winter. The days are short, dark, and cloudy. This would be fine if Chicago had a fossil fuel backup to use in the winter, or at night for that matter, but they won't. If they want to be **100%** renewable, they'll either have to install way more solar panels than they need just to prepare for those dark days, or invest in crazy energy storage solutions.

To see for yourself, try finding the solar irradiance for Chicago using this website: [http://www.solarelectricityhandbook.com/solar-irradiance.html](http://www.solarelectricityhandbook.com/solar-irradiance.html)

Make sure you select the proper solar panel angle; otherwise, it will tell you the irradiance figures for horizontal panels, which isn't representative of a real installation.

If we accept the erroneous premise of these comments that Chicago is giving up nuclear energy to move to wind and solar then we can see that even if those two latter sources had the ability to supply the city (and they don't), the city would still increase its greenhouse gas emissions.  But because wind and solar are subject to intermittent failures the city will be buying energy from much more carbon intensive sources.  Chicago's emissions will go up thanks to this decision."

Here a [research paper form 2013](https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=913633).

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

1. They are expensive as hell and take forever to build. 

2. Theyre permanent, and I dont mean like, theyll be there for a long time permanent.

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems. It's just to me we need at least one more wave of new plants to keep us with green energy until renewables and battery tech catch up enough to actually manage to work as base load for the nation. (or fusion gets figured out). "
"7711",2042,"onequarterbritish",24,19,13,3,0,"Your points are somewhat valid, but there's some room for accuracy and context.

1. They're expensive, but this is partly due to regulation. Most often nuclear power plants are given permits by the unit, which means that it makes sense to build the biggest unit possible at once to reduce the load from bureaucracy and politics. Smaller, modular power plants would have smaller upfront costs and shorter build times, and the capacity could be increased over time by starting with small capacity, which allows them to start turning profit sooner. Overall nuclear power plants aren't really expensive in the sense that eventually they'll turn out to be very profitable, but it often takes time due to the large size of the plants since from regulation point of view there's little difference between building 10 large plants or 10 small plants. If the regulation changes, this could change too.

For 2. and 3., there's really no need to monitor the plants after decommission. There's waste that needs to be cared for, but when compared to all the other waste production by humankind, nuclear waste is perhaps the least of our worries. Importantly, the waste is extremely dense so volume-wise it's very compact. All of the nuclear waste from spent fuel since the 1950's would fit inside a single football field. Furthermore, there are reactor designs that can reuse spent fuel up to a degree, reducing the amount of final waste further. However, due to being quite a stigmatized field, as well as uranium simply being cheap, there's been little investments towards this technology and its commercialization."
"7712",2050,"WorBlux",24,20,13,2,0,"1. For current gen reactors in western nations where labor is expensive, this is quite true.  It's not necessarily true of potential future designs.  I think the money is a lot better spent in r+d, and regulatory reform than trying to build  more PWR reactors. "

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc."
"7736",152,"realityChemist",24,6,151,6,0,"To your second point, decentralized generation is a no-go *until* significantly better battery/capacitor tech gets figured out. If you try to implement in the other order, you're going to end up with rolling brown outs as the amount of power and demand both fluctuate dramatically and in an uncorrelated way.

So saying we shouldn't invest in any new nuclear is essentially a gamble that we'll figure the storage problem out before the demand for non-CO2-emitting generation reaches the point where we would have preferred having those nuclear plants. As someone who's spent several years working in advanced electronic materials, and given the current state of the environment, I'm not sure that's a gamble I'd take.

"7743",556,"slipstream808",24,8,4,12,1,"Economically not feasible.  They take way to long to build and too much money.  In this timeframe you end up with cost overruns and delays in schedule.  Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."

"7758",2086,"caesarfecit",24,21,1449,39,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"7759",2087,"LLJKTympanic",24,21,1449,26,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs. 

Agree with everything else though. As annoying as INPO can be at times, it's certainly better to have it than not."

And yet they weren't prevented. I'm a firm believer in the safety potential of nuclear, however nuclear power doesn't exist in a theoretical construct - it exists in an economic reality - one which routinely demands concessions in reactor design, in operation, in maintenance, in disposal, and so on. 

Nuclear power is only viable as a safe solution if it's cost competitive with other energy forms. Right now that's coal and natural gas, but in the future it's solar and wind. CA has been working on energy policy and climate change for 40 years - longer than anyone on earth - and the state has decided to shutter it's nuclear plants because we've determined that there's a path to a sustainable grid that doesn't need them. Mandates such as adequate solar capacity on new home construction, likely being extended to whole house batteries, wind and geothermal power, grid-level storage, research across the state into wave energy harvesting, and so on when combined with aggressive conservation (consider that California has reduced it's need for electricity by 50% relative to the rest of the US - if you stop wasting electricity, then you don't need to burn coal to produce the waste) means we don't need to rely on nuclear. 

There are other benefits to this approach. Less transmission losses by generating closer to consumption. More (but also more complex) redundancy in the grid. 

Consider the whole calculation - if CA distributed sufficient rooftop and grid solar, wind, and battery storage across the state to cover 95% of the electricity demand, and needed supplemental power only 5% of the time, what is the most economical way of handling that? It's not a nuclear plant which has relatively long ramp up/down times. It's great for base load, but we don't need base load - we need peaker plants - like this week when we've had a ton of rain and cloud cover. The state has determined that we'd actually be environmentally better off keeping some fossil fuel plants online for this purpose rather than build a modern, safe nuclear plant, If you get their utility down low enough, then it becomes cheaper to carbon capture your emissions than to prevent them in the first place. 

An Allam Cycle natural gas plant (first one has been built in Texas) captures it's own CO2 and has no unburned methane as exhaust. It's about 59% efficient, which includes the capture. And the plants can be relatively small. Now, we don't want to run the entire grid off of such plants because you still have the problems of emissions due to methane leakage and other costs for production and transport, but if you can keep that need down to a minimum, you can better manage it within your economic window. 

The state is also looking to use excess electricity production from renewables (CA is already having to pay AZ and NV to take some of our excess solar production) to power hydrogen production from electrolysis. It's not a terribly efficient process, but if you have too much power on the grid, who cares? Hydrogen becomes another easily storable, transportable fuel that can be used to produce power with no emissions. 

It's the combined approach of all of these things that makes nuclear unviable. Nuclear only really makes sense if you are unwilling to do them."

Like a lot of groups, there are hard divides within. You have pro and anti nuclear within ""the movement"" so to speak.

The only problem with nuclear is how expensive it is to do properly - including building and then decommissioning reactors safely. Hinkly C is on track to be one (if not the) most expensive power plants of any type to be built."

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps.

* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "
"7912",2020,"filbert227",24,18,1046,5,0,"The problem is baseload is a lot more complex than just sending power from one region to another.  The grid may be connected across a pretty large distance but power isn't really sent that far in comparison to the three u.s. grids sizes.  Sending the energy from Arizona where the sun is intense all the way up to Colorado because it's overcast is incredibly inefficient.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.

Nuclear takes too long to build, costs too much up front, and carries too much risk (of being unprofitable due to changing economics, cost overruns, construction delays, etc.  The risk from radioactive material release is very small, but the risk of going bankrupt trying to run a nuclear energy company is huge.)

Nuclear is great in concept but if the target is 2035 then it's a non-starter, it just takes too long to build and commission and nobody wants to take on the financial risk to build new reactors in the private market.  We would have to have a government-run nuclear energy company that built reactors with public funds paid for by a tax on the people to make it actually work, and that's fundamentally opposed to the country's capitalist republic nature.

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

You're first three sentences are fine, but these plants are not old, not falling apart, and not producing anymore waste compared to other sources of energy. They were built to run for 60 years and they should all achieve that, with most of the plants going over past the design base and running for 80 years.  There is so much oversight from the NRC to Exelon/s own oversight that broken stuff just doesn't go unnoticed. I'm also guessing your'e thinking of other political parties that want to shut down nuclear because Illinois is fine with it, half of the electricity illinois produced comes from nuclear power. You also must have missed where the state lawmakers passed a law to help out Quad/Clinton compete against power producers.

If we accept the erroneous premise of these comments that Chicago is giving up nuclear energy to move to wind and solar then we can see that even if those two latter sources had the ability to supply the city (and they don't), the city would still increase its greenhouse gas emissions.

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw. These big showy ""improvements"" are often just ""let's throw a bunch of money around and get good PR for a few years, and hope it works out"" "

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems. It's just to me we need at least one more wave of new plants to keep us with green energy until renewables and battery tech catch up enough to actually manage to work as base load for the nation. (or fusion gets figured out). "
"8142",2042,"onequarterbritish",25,19,13,3,0,"Your points are somewhat valid, but there's some room for accuracy and context.

1. They're expensive, but this is partly due to regulation. Most often nuclear power plants are given permits by the unit, which means that it makes sense to build the biggest unit possible at once to reduce the load from bureaucracy and politics. Smaller, modular power plants would have smaller upfront costs and shorter build times, and the capacity could be increased over time by starting with small capacity, which allows them to start turning profit sooner. Overall nuclear power plants aren't really expensive in the sense that eventually they'll turn out to be very profitable, but it often takes time due to the large size of the plants since from regulation point of view there's little difference between building 10 large plants or 10 small plants. If the regulation changes, this could change too.

For 2. and 3., there's really no need to monitor the plants after decommission. There's waste that needs to be cared for, but when compared to all the other waste production by humankind, nuclear waste is perhaps the least of our worries. Importantly, the waste is extremely dense so volume-wise it's very compact. All of the nuclear waste from spent fuel since the 1950's would fit inside a single football field. Furthermore, there are reactor designs that can reuse spent fuel up to a degree, reducing the amount of final waste further. However, due to being quite a stigmatized field, as well as uranium simply being cheap, there's been little investments towards this technology and its commercialization."

"8168",555,"slipstream808",25,8,4,9,1,"Economically not feasible.  They take way to long to build and too much money.  In this timeframe you end up with cost overruns and delays in schedule.  Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."
"8169",556,"billdietrich1",25,8,4,4,0,"Building new nuclear is a bad idea because:

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc."

So saying we shouldn't invest in any new nuclear is essentially a gamble that we'll figure the storage problem out before the demand for non-CO2-emitting generation reaches the point where we would have preferred having those nuclear plants. As someone who's spent several years working in advanced electronic materials, and given the current state of the environment, I'm not sure that's a gamble I'd take.

"8186",2086,"caesarfecit",25,21,1449,41,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"8187",2087,"LLJKTympanic",25,21,1449,27,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs.

And yet they weren't prevented. I'm a firm believer in the safety potential of nuclear, however nuclear power doesn't exist in a theoretical construct - it exists in an economic reality - one which routinely demands concessions in reactor design, in operation, in maintenance, in disposal, and so on. 

Nuclear power is only viable as a safe solution if it's cost competitive with other energy forms. Right now that's coal and natural gas, but in the future it's solar and wind. CA has been working on energy policy and climate change for 40 years - longer than anyone on earth - and the state has decided to shutter it's nuclear plants because we've determined that there's a path to a sustainable grid that doesn't need them. Mandates such as adequate solar capacity on new home construction, likely being extended to whole house batteries, wind and geothermal power, grid-level storage, research across the state into wave energy harvesting, and so on when combined with aggressive conservation (consider that California has reduced it's need for electricity by 50% relative to the rest of the US - if you stop wasting electricity, then you don't need to burn coal to produce the waste) means we don't need to rely on nuclear. 

There are other benefits to this approach. Less transmission losses by generating closer to consumption. More (but also more complex) redundancy in the grid. 

Consider the whole calculation - if CA distributed sufficient rooftop and grid solar, wind, and battery storage across the state to cover 95% of the electricity demand, and needed supplemental power only 5% of the time, what is the most economical way of handling that? It's not a nuclear plant which has relatively long ramp up/down times. It's great for base load, but we don't need base load - we need peaker plants - like this week when we've had a ton of rain and cloud cover. The state has determined that we'd actually be environmentally better off keeping some fossil fuel plants online for this purpose rather than build a modern, safe nuclear plant, If you get their utility down low enough, then it becomes cheaper to carbon capture your emissions than to prevent them in the first place. 

An Allam Cycle natural gas plant (first one has been built in Texas) captures it's own CO2 and has no unburned methane as exhaust. It's about 59% efficient, which includes the capture. And the plants can be relatively small. Now, we don't want to run the entire grid off of such plants because you still have the problems of emissions due to methane leakage and other costs for production and transport, but if you can keep that need down to a minimum, you can better manage it within your economic window. 

The state is also looking to use excess electricity production from renewables (CA is already having to pay AZ and NV to take some of our excess solar production) to power hydrogen production from electrolysis. It's not a terribly efficient process, but if you have too much power on the grid, who cares? Hydrogen becomes another easily storable, transportable fuel that can be used to produce power with no emissions. 

It's the combined approach of all of these things that makes nuclear unviable. Nuclear only really makes sense if you are unwilling to do them."

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps. Surplus renewables will then be put to work creating syn-gas/hydrogen or some other derivative to feed into the gas network. Last paragraph is just my opinion, rest is as factual as I could make it."

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

Telling people that ""green won't work"" isn't going to make nuclear happen, it's just going to make coal and natural gas happen.  It's counter-productive.  Nuclear takes too long to build, costs too much up front, and carries too much risk (of being unprofitable due to changing economics, cost overruns, construction delays, etc.  The risk from radioactive material release is very small, but the risk of going bankrupt trying to run a nuclear energy company is huge.)

Nuclear is great in concept but if the target is 2035 then it's a non-starter, it just takes too long to build and commission and nobody wants to take on the financial risk to build new reactors in the private market.  We would have to have a government-run nuclear energy company that built reactors with public funds paid for by a tax on the people to make it actually work, and that's fundamentally opposed to the country's capitalist republic nature.

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

Hydro doesn't need to be pumped if it's only used as needed to cover fluctuations and base load. This also leaves more water available for agriculture.

Here's a better one: 1. keep existing nukes running as long as we safely can. 2. Build loads of renewables because they're cheaper than anything else and also clean. 3. Keep investing in advanced nuclear in the hope it can be cost competitive with renewables+storage. 4. As we get close to 60-70% renewables (the current easy-to-manage limit), decide whether it's worth building current generation nuclear at its overinflated cost or deploy cheaper/better advanced nukes if they're cheap enough.

Chicago can be considered the nuclear city because the [Chicago Pile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1), the first controllable nuclear reactor, was located under Stagg Field at the University of Chicago.  It is fortunate that the city later had a number of nuclear reactors constructed around it as that undoubtedly saved untold thousands of lives.

Here a [research paper form 2013](https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=913633).

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

"8452",742,"Backout2allenn",25,8,741,4,0,"A. This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition).

1. They are expensive as hell and take forever to build.

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems. It's just to me we need at least one more wave of new plants to keep us with green energy until renewables and battery tech catch up enough to actually manage to work as base load for the nation. (or fusion gets figured out). "
"8570",2042,"onequarterbritish",26,19,13,3,0,"Your points are somewhat valid, but there's some room for accuracy and context.

1. They're expensive, but this is partly due to regulation. Most often nuclear power plants are given permits by the unit, which means that it makes sense to build the biggest unit possible at once to reduce the load from bureaucracy and politics. Smaller, modular power plants would have smaller upfront costs and shorter build times, and the capacity could be increased over time by starting with small capacity, which allows them to start turning profit sooner. Overall nuclear power plants aren't really expensive in the sense that eventually they'll turn out to be very profitable, but it often takes time due to the large size of the plants since from regulation point of view there's little difference between building 10 large plants or 10 small plants. If the regulation changes, this could change too.

For 2. and 3., there's really no need to monitor the plants after decommission. There's waste that needs to be cared for, but when compared to all the other waste production by humankind, nuclear waste is perhaps the least of our worries. Importantly, the waste is extremely dense so volume-wise it's very compact. All of the nuclear waste from spent fuel since the 1950's would fit inside a single football field. Furthermore, there are reactor designs that can reuse spent fuel up to a degree, reducing the amount of final waste further. However, due to being quite a stigmatized field, as well as uranium simply being cheap, there's been little investments towards this technology and its commercialization."

"8597",555,"slipstream808",26,8,4,11,1,"Economically not feasible.  They take way to long to build and too much money.  In this timeframe you end up with cost overruns and delays in schedule.  Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."
"8598",556,"billdietrich1",26,8,4,4,0,"Building new nuclear is a bad idea because:

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc."
"8599",557,"realityChemist",26,8,556,5,0,"To your second point, decentralized generation is a no-go *until* significantly better battery/capacitor tech gets figured out. If you try to implement in the other order, you're going to end up with rolling brown outs as the amount of power and demand both fluctuate dramatically and in an uncorrelated way.

So saying we shouldn't invest in any new nuclear is essentially a gamble that we'll figure the storage problem out before the demand for non-CO2-emitting generation reaches the point where we would have preferred having those nuclear plants. As someone who's spent several years working in advanced electronic materials, and given the current state of the environment, I'm not sure that's a gamble I'd take.

"8615",2086,"caesarfecit",26,21,1449,43,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"8616",2087,"LLJKTympanic",26,21,1449,26,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

&gt;

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs. 

Agree with everything else though. As annoying as INPO can be at times, it's certainly better to have it than not."

"8620",1821,"bubba-yo",26,16,34,2,0,"""Yep, the one commonality in every nuclear power accident is that they were preventable.""

And yet they weren't prevented. I'm a firm believer in the safety potential of nuclear, however nuclear power doesn't exist in a theoretical construct - it exists in an economic reality - one which routinely demands concessions in reactor design, in operation, in maintenance, in disposal, and so on. 

Nuclear power is only viable as a safe solution if it's cost competitive with other energy forms. Right now that's coal and natural gas, but in the future it's solar and wind. CA has been working on energy policy and climate change for 40 years - longer than anyone on earth - and the state has decided to shutter it's nuclear plants because we've determined that there's a path to a sustainable grid that doesn't need them. Mandates such as adequate solar capacity on new home construction, likely being extended to whole house batteries, wind and geothermal power, grid-level storage, research across the state into wave energy harvesting, and so on when combined with aggressive conservation (consider that California has reduced it's need for electricity by 50% relative to the rest of the US - if you stop wasting electricity, then you don't need to burn coal to produce the waste) means we don't need to rely on nuclear. 

There are other benefits to this approach. Less transmission losses by generating closer to consumption. More (but also more complex) redundancy in the grid. 

Consider the whole calculation - if CA distributed sufficient rooftop and grid solar, wind, and battery storage across the state to cover 95% of the electricity demand, and needed supplemental power only 5% of the time, what is the most economical way of handling that? It's not a nuclear plant which has relatively long ramp up/down times. It's great for base load, but we don't need base load - we need peaker plants - like this week when we've had a ton of rain and cloud cover. The state has determined that we'd actually be environmentally better off keeping some fossil fuel plants online for this purpose rather than build a modern, safe nuclear plant, If you get their utility down low enough, then it becomes cheaper to carbon capture your emissions than to prevent them in the first place. 

An Allam Cycle natural gas plant (first one has been built in Texas) captures it's own CO2 and has no unburned methane as exhaust. It's about 59% efficient, which includes the capture. And the plants can be relatively small. Now, we don't want to run the entire grid off of such plants because you still have the problems of emissions due to methane leakage and other costs for production and transport, but if you can keep that need down to a minimum, you can better manage it within your economic window. 

The state is also looking to use excess electricity production from renewables (CA is already having to pay AZ and NV to take some of our excess solar production) to power hydrogen production from electrolysis. It's not a terribly efficient process, but if you have too much power on the grid, who cares? Hydrogen becomes another easily storable, transportable fuel that can be used to produce power with no emissions. 

It's the combined approach of all of these things that makes nuclear unviable. Nuclear only really makes sense if you are unwilling to do them."

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

There is no reason we cant go nuclear and stay nuclear. Its cleaner and more efficient than renewables will ever be.

Batteries store energy. Energy is volatile. More energy density in one place means more volatility. Do you need a scientific source for this, or are current events and common knowledge enough?

His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps. Surplus renewables will then be put to work creating syn-gas/hydrogen or some other derivative to feed into the gas network. Last paragraph is just my opinion, rest is as factual as I could make it."

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

"8769",412,"wordfool",26,7,125,14,0,"Problem with nuclear (in the West at least) is no-one seems to be able to build a new nuke power station anywhere close to budget or on time. It's green, emissions-wise, but f-ing expensive just to build, let alone to dispose of the waste long-term. Oh, and building a new plant takes a looooong time. 

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "
"8770",413,"filbert227",26,7,412,4,0,"The problem is baseload is a lot more complex than just sending power from one region to another.  The grid may be connected across a pretty large distance but power isn't really sent that far in comparison to the three u.s. grids sizes.  Sending the energy from Arizona where the sun is intense all the way up to Colorado because it's overcast is incredibly inefficient.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I almost forgot...  I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.  Look into dry cask storage and you'll see what I mean.  All the fuel we've used since the plant was commissioned is stored safely on site using this dry cask storage program."
"8771",1845,"caesarfecit",26,16,412,11,0,"The reason why they take forever to build is because of the regulatory process in most countries, NIMBY bullshit, and the fact that every power station is ""bespoke"" or a unique project. The reactor designs are similar but their implementation and finer features are often unique to the installation.

There's new designs like the LFTR which are far safer, smaller, and use thorium rather than uranium, which means far less and shorter lived waste.

It's a pipe dream to believe nuclear has a chance at this point and it's a cunt move to go around shitting on the other options telling everyone that nuclear is the only way when it's *never* going to happen.  Telling people that ""green won't work"" isn't going to make nuclear happen, it's just going to make coal and natural gas happen.  It's counter-productive.  Nuclear takes too long to build, costs too much up front, and carries too much risk (of being unprofitable due to changing economics, cost overruns, construction delays, etc.  The risk from radioactive material release is very small, but the risk of going bankrupt trying to run a nuclear energy company is huge.)

Nuclear is great in concept but if the target is 2035 then it's a non-starter, it just takes too long to build and commission and nobody wants to take on the financial risk to build new reactors in the private market.  We would have to have a government-run nuclear energy company that built reactors with public funds paid for by a tax on the people to make it actually work, and that's fundamentally opposed to the country's capitalist republic nature.

It's one thing to cry about how nuclear would save the world, because it would, if we lived in a Trekian utopia, but it's *not going to* and shitting on wind and solar because you're mad nuclear missed the boat is cutting off your nose to spite your face."

Pumped hydro is a great solution, but as you pointed out, there's very little of it and no realistic plans to expand it due to the obscene investment required and volume of land needed.

&gt; Solar/wind will be important components of a future grid makeup, but due to their variability they cannot supply the whole grid, at least until there is a viable storage method available.

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

Hydro doesn't need to be pumped if it's only used as needed to cover fluctuations and base load. This also leaves more water available for agriculture.

&gt; This is one of the core reasons nuclear is so important, it provides a reliable base portion of the grid, which has no variability based on weather.

Those which require river water for cooling can be restricted by low levels, though this is not very common.

I'm also guessing your'e thinking of other political parties that want to shut down nuclear because Illinois is fine with it, half of the electricity illinois produced comes from nuclear power.

If we accept the erroneous premise of these comments that Chicago is giving up nuclear energy to move to wind and solar then we can see that even if those two latter sources had the ability to supply the city (and they don't), the city would still increase its greenhouse gas emissions.  But because wind and solar are subject to intermittent failures the city will be buying energy from much more carbon intensive sources.  Chicago's emissions will go up thanks to this decision."

Here a [research paper form 2013](https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=913633).

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

"8881",742,"Backout2allenn",26,8,741,5,0,"A. This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

There's not enough money in pot taxes to eliminate fossil fuel power plants or provide health insurance to all the uninsured or *any* of these ""just use the marijuana money"" comments I see on Reddit."

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

I definitely see both sides to this debate, but nuclear power along with heavy investment in other renewables is possibly our best bet right now. I only have 3 issues with nuclear power and none of them are radiation getting out and creating flipper babies or Godzillas:

1. They are expensive as hell and take forever to build. 

2. Theyre permanent, and I dont mean like, theyll be there for a long time permanent. I mean that even after theyre turned off, theyre still there with people monitoring them making sure that they dont melt down for generations. Theyll be the medieval cathedrals that we leave future generations. 

3. The nuclear waste. With newer technology, this is getting mitigated to smaller and less potent amounts, but its still something that we have to deal with.

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems. It's just to me we need at least one more wave of new plants to keep us with green energy until renewables and battery tech catch up enough to actually manage to work as base load for the nation. (or fusion gets figured out). "
"8998",2042,"onequarterbritish",27,19,13,3,0,"Your points are somewhat valid, but there's some room for accuracy and context.

1. They're expensive, but this is partly due to regulation. Most often nuclear power plants are given permits by the unit, which means that it makes sense to build the biggest unit possible at once to reduce the load from bureaucracy and politics. Smaller, modular power plants would have smaller upfront costs and shorter build times, and the capacity could be increased over time by starting with small capacity, which allows them to start turning profit sooner. Overall nuclear power plants aren't really expensive in the sense that eventually they'll turn out to be very profitable, but it often takes time due to the large size of the plants since from regulation point of view there's little difference between building 10 large plants or 10 small plants. If the regulation changes, this could change too.

For 2. and 3., there's really no need to monitor the plants after decommission. There's waste that needs to be cared for, but when compared to all the other waste production by humankind, nuclear waste is perhaps the least of our worries. Importantly, the waste is extremely dense so volume-wise it's very compact. All of the nuclear waste from spent fuel since the 1950's would fit inside a single football field. Furthermore, there are reactor designs that can reuse spent fuel up to a degree, reducing the amount of final waste further. However, due to being quite a stigmatized field, as well as uranium simply being cheap, there's been little investments towards this technology and its commercialization."

"9025",555,"slipstream808",27,8,4,10,1,"Economically not feasible.  They take way to long to build and too much money.  In this timeframe you end up with cost overruns and delays in schedule.  Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."
"9026",556,"billdietrich1",27,8,4,3,0,"Building new nuclear is a bad idea because:

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc."
"9027",557,"realityChemist",27,8,556,6,0,"To your second point, decentralized generation is a no-go *until* significantly better battery/capacitor tech gets figured out. If you try to implement in the other order, you're going to end up with rolling brown outs as the amount of power and demand both fluctuate dramatically and in an uncorrelated way.

So saying we shouldn't invest in any new nuclear is essentially a gamble that we'll figure the storage problem out before the demand for non-CO2-emitting generation reaches the point where we would have preferred having those nuclear plants. As someone who's spent several years working in advanced electronic materials, and given the current state of the environment, I'm not sure that's a gamble I'd take.

"9043",2086,"caesarfecit",27,21,1449,41,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"9044",2087,"LLJKTympanic",27,21,1449,26,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs. 

Agree with everything else though. As annoying as INPO can be at times, it's certainly better to have it than not."

And yet they weren't prevented. I'm a firm believer in the safety potential of nuclear, however nuclear power doesn't exist in a theoretical construct - it exists in an economic reality - one which routinely demands concessions in reactor design, in operation, in maintenance, in disposal, and so on. 

Nuclear power is only viable as a safe solution if it's cost competitive with other energy forms. Right now that's coal and natural gas, but in the future it's solar and wind. CA has been working on energy policy and climate change for 40 years - longer than anyone on earth - and the state has decided to shutter it's nuclear plants because we've determined that there's a path to a sustainable grid that doesn't need them. Mandates such as adequate solar capacity on new home construction, likely being extended to whole house batteries, wind and geothermal power, grid-level storage, research across the state into wave energy harvesting, and so on when combined with aggressive conservation (consider that California has reduced it's need for electricity by 50% relative to the rest of the US - if you stop wasting electricity, then you don't need to burn coal to produce the waste) means we don't need to rely on nuclear. 

There are other benefits to this approach. Less transmission losses by generating closer to consumption. More (but also more complex) redundancy in the grid. 

Consider the whole calculation - if CA distributed sufficient rooftop and grid solar, wind, and battery storage across the state to cover 95% of the electricity demand, and needed supplemental power only 5% of the time, what is the most economical way of handling that? It's not a nuclear plant which has relatively long ramp up/down times. It's great for base load, but we don't need base load - we need peaker plants - like this week when we've had a ton of rain and cloud cover. The state has determined that we'd actually be environmentally better off keeping some fossil fuel plants online for this purpose rather than build a modern, safe nuclear plant, If you get their utility down low enough, then it becomes cheaper to carbon capture your emissions than to prevent them in the first place. 

An Allam Cycle natural gas plant (first one has been built in Texas) captures it's own CO2 and has no unburned methane as exhaust. It's about 59% efficient, which includes the capture. And the plants can be relatively small. Now, we don't want to run the entire grid off of such plants because you still have the problems of emissions due to methane leakage and other costs for production and transport, but if you can keep that need down to a minimum, you can better manage it within your economic window. 

The state is also looking to use excess electricity production from renewables (CA is already having to pay AZ and NV to take some of our excess solar production) to power hydrogen production from electrolysis. It's not a terribly efficient process, but if you have too much power on the grid, who cares? Hydrogen becomes another easily storable, transportable fuel that can be used to produce power with no emissions. 

It's the combined approach of all of these things that makes nuclear unviable. Nuclear only really makes sense if you are unwilling to do them."

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

That's fair enough for your average person chatting shit on Reddit, but people who work 'with electricity' then try to argue from a position of authority and often hilariously wrong. Just as an example, I had a conversation with a grid engineer the other day in work and all his assumptions were way off, he used a capacity factor of 20% for wind, whereas in reality, offshore wind is now hitting 50-60%. His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps. Surplus renewables will then be put to work creating syn-gas/hydrogen or some other derivative to feed into the gas network. Last paragraph is just my opinion, rest is as factual as I could make it."

* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.

"
"9179",1834,"wolfkeeper",27,16,1832,2,0,"If I've understood you correctly, there's another carbon neutral system, where there's (say) solar connected on the grid, and it's owned by a producer, who is being paid by customers, who take their electricity from the grid and get metered in the completely normal way.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "
"9199",413,"filbert227",27,7,412,5,0,"The problem is baseload is a lot more complex than just sending power from one region to another.  The grid may be connected across a pretty large distance but power isn't really sent that far in comparison to the three u.s. grids sizes.  Sending the energy from Arizona where the sun is intense all the way up to Colorado because it's overcast is incredibly inefficient.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I almost forgot...  I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.

Nuclear takes too long to build, costs too much up front, and carries too much risk (of being unprofitable due to changing economics, cost overruns, construction delays, etc.  The risk from radioactive material release is very small, but the risk of going bankrupt trying to run a nuclear energy company is huge.)

Nuclear is great in concept but if the target is 2035 then it's a non-starter, it just takes too long to build and commission and nobody wants to take on the financial risk to build new reactors in the private market.  We would have to have a government-run nuclear energy company that built reactors with public funds paid for by a tax on the people to make it actually work, and that's fundamentally opposed to the country's capitalist republic nature.

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon.

B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process.

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

I definitely see both sides to this debate, but nuclear power along with heavy investment in other renewables is possibly our best bet right now. I only have 3 issues with nuclear power and none of them are radiation getting out and creating flipper babies or Godzillas:

1. They are expensive as hell and take forever to build. 

2. Theyre permanent, and I dont mean like, theyll be there for a long time permanent. I mean that even after theyre turned off, theyre still there with people monitoring them making sure that they dont melt down for generations. Theyll be the medieval cathedrals that we leave future generations. 

3. The nuclear waste. With newer technology, this is getting mitigated to smaller and less potent amounts, but its still something that we have to deal with.

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems. It's just to me we need at least one more wave of new plants to keep us with green energy until renewables and battery tech catch up enough to actually manage to work as base load for the nation. (or fusion gets figured out). "
"9427",2042,"onequarterbritish",28,19,13,3,0,"Your points are somewhat valid, but there's some room for accuracy and context.

1. They're expensive, but this is partly due to regulation. Most often nuclear power plants are given permits by the unit, which means that it makes sense to build the biggest unit possible at once to reduce the load from bureaucracy and politics. Smaller, modular power plants would have smaller upfront costs and shorter build times, and the capacity could be increased over time by starting with small capacity, which allows them to start turning profit sooner. Overall nuclear power plants aren't really expensive in the sense that eventually they'll turn out to be very profitable, but it often takes time due to the large size of the plants since from regulation point of view there's little difference between building 10 large plants or 10 small plants. If the regulation changes, this could change too.

For 2. and 3., there's really no need to monitor the plants after decommission. There's waste that needs to be cared for, but when compared to all the other waste production by humankind, nuclear waste is perhaps the least of our worries. Importantly, the waste is extremely dense so volume-wise it's very compact. All of the nuclear waste from spent fuel since the 1950's would fit inside a single football field. Furthermore, there are reactor designs that can reuse spent fuel up to a degree, reducing the amount of final waste further. However, due to being quite a stigmatized field, as well as uranium simply being cheap, there's been little investments towards this technology and its commercialization."
"9428",2050,"WorBlux",28,20,13,2,0,"1. For current gen reactors in western nations where labor is expensive, this is quite true.  It's not necessarily true of potential future designs.  I think the money is a lot better spent in r+d, and regulatory reform than trying to build  more PWR reactors. "

"9454",555,"slipstream808",28,8,4,11,1,"Economically not feasible.  They take way to long to build and too much money.  In this timeframe you end up with cost overruns and delays in schedule.  Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."
"9455",556,"billdietrich1",28,8,4,4,0,"Building new nuclear is a bad idea because:

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc."
"9456",557,"realityChemist",28,8,556,5,0,"To your second point, decentralized generation is a no-go *until* significantly better battery/capacitor tech gets figured out. If you try to implement in the other order, you're going to end up with rolling brown outs as the amount of power and demand both fluctuate dramatically and in an uncorrelated way.

So saying we shouldn't invest in any new nuclear is essentially a gamble that we'll figure the storage problem out before the demand for non-CO2-emitting generation reaches the point where we would have preferred having those nuclear plants. As someone who's spent several years working in advanced electronic materials, and given the current state of the environment, I'm not sure that's a gamble I'd take.

"9472",2086,"caesarfecit",28,21,1449,38,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"9473",2087,"LLJKTympanic",28,21,1449,26,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs.

And yet they weren't prevented. I'm a firm believer in the safety potential of nuclear, however nuclear power doesn't exist in a theoretical construct - it exists in an economic reality - one which routinely demands concessions in reactor design, in operation, in maintenance, in disposal, and so on. 

Nuclear power is only viable as a safe solution if it's cost competitive with other energy forms. Right now that's coal and natural gas, but in the future it's solar and wind. CA has been working on energy policy and climate change for 40 years - longer than anyone on earth - and the state has decided to shutter it's nuclear plants because we've determined that there's a path to a sustainable grid that doesn't need them. Mandates such as adequate solar capacity on new home construction, likely being extended to whole house batteries, wind and geothermal power, grid-level storage, research across the state into wave energy harvesting, and so on when combined with aggressive conservation (consider that California has reduced it's need for electricity by 50% relative to the rest of the US - if you stop wasting electricity, then you don't need to burn coal to produce the waste) means we don't need to rely on nuclear. 

There are other benefits to this approach. Less transmission losses by generating closer to consumption. More (but also more complex) redundancy in the grid. 

Consider the whole calculation - if CA distributed sufficient rooftop and grid solar, wind, and battery storage across the state to cover 95% of the electricity demand, and needed supplemental power only 5% of the time, what is the most economical way of handling that? It's not a nuclear plant which has relatively long ramp up/down times. It's great for base load, but we don't need base load - we need peaker plants - like this week when we've had a ton of rain and cloud cover. The state has determined that we'd actually be environmentally better off keeping some fossil fuel plants online for this purpose rather than build a modern, safe nuclear plant, If you get their utility down low enough, then it becomes cheaper to carbon capture your emissions than to prevent them in the first place. 

An Allam Cycle natural gas plant (first one has been built in Texas) captures it's own CO2 and has no unburned methane as exhaust. It's about 59% efficient, which includes the capture. And the plants can be relatively small. Now, we don't want to run the entire grid off of such plants because you still have the problems of emissions due to methane leakage and other costs for production and transport, but if you can keep that need down to a minimum, you can better manage it within your economic window. 

The state is also looking to use excess electricity production from renewables (CA is already having to pay AZ and NV to take some of our excess solar production) to power hydrogen production from electrolysis. It's not a terribly efficient process, but if you have too much power on the grid, who cares? Hydrogen becomes another easily storable, transportable fuel that can be used to produce power with no emissions. 

It's the combined approach of all of these things that makes nuclear unviable. Nuclear only really makes sense if you are unwilling to do them."

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

Just as an example, I had a conversation with a grid engineer the other day in work and all his assumptions were way off, he used a capacity factor of 20% for wind, whereas in reality, offshore wind is now hitting 50-60%. His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps.

* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.

"

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

Nuclear takes too long to build, costs too much up front, and carries too much risk (of being unprofitable due to changing economics, cost overruns, construction delays, etc.  The risk from radioactive material release is very small, but the risk of going bankrupt trying to run a nuclear energy company is huge.)

Nuclear is great in concept but if the target is 2035 then it's a non-starter, it just takes too long to build and commission and nobody wants to take on the financial risk to build new reactors in the private market.

Pumped hydro is a great solution, but as you pointed out, there's very little of it and no realistic plans to expand it due to the obscene investment required and volume of land needed.

&gt; Solar/wind will be important components of a future grid makeup, but due to their variability they cannot supply the whole grid, at least until there is a viable storage method available.

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

Hydro doesn't need to be pumped if it's only used as needed to cover fluctuations and base load. This also leaves more water available for agriculture.

Here a [research paper form 2013](https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=913633).

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

"9739",742,"Backout2allenn",28,8,741,4,0,"A. This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems. It's just to me we need at least one more wave of new plants to keep us with green energy until renewables and battery tech catch up enough to actually manage to work as base load for the nation. (or fusion gets figured out). "
"9857",2042,"onequarterbritish",29,19,13,3,0,"Your points are somewhat valid, but there's some room for accuracy and context.

1. They're expensive, but this is partly due to regulation. Most often nuclear power plants are given permits by the unit, which means that it makes sense to build the biggest unit possible at once to reduce the load from bureaucracy and politics. Smaller, modular power plants would have smaller upfront costs and shorter build times, and the capacity could be increased over time by starting with small capacity, which allows them to start turning profit sooner. Overall nuclear power plants aren't really expensive in the sense that eventually they'll turn out to be very profitable, but it often takes time due to the large size of the plants since from regulation point of view there's little difference between building 10 large plants or 10 small plants. If the regulation changes, this could change too.

For 2. and 3., there's really no need to monitor the plants after decommission. There's waste that needs to be cared for, but when compared to all the other waste production by humankind, nuclear waste is perhaps the least of our worries. Importantly, the waste is extremely dense so volume-wise it's very compact. All of the nuclear waste from spent fuel since the 1950's would fit inside a single football field. Furthermore, there are reactor designs that can reuse spent fuel up to a degree, reducing the amount of final waste further. However, due to being quite a stigmatized field, as well as uranium simply being cheap, there's been little investments towards this technology and its commercialization."

"9884",555,"slipstream808",29,8,4,13,1,"Economically not feasible.  They take way to long to build and too much money.  In this timeframe you end up with cost overruns and delays in schedule.  Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."
"9885",556,"billdietrich1",29,8,4,4,0,"Building new nuclear is a bad idea because:

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc."
"9886",557,"realityChemist",29,8,556,5,0,"To your second point, decentralized generation is a no-go *until* significantly better battery/capacitor tech gets figured out. If you try to implement in the other order, you're going to end up with rolling brown outs as the amount of power and demand both fluctuate dramatically and in an uncorrelated way.

So saying we shouldn't invest in any new nuclear is essentially a gamble that we'll figure the storage problem out before the demand for non-CO2-emitting generation reaches the point where we would have preferred having those nuclear plants. As someone who's spent several years working in advanced electronic materials, and given the current state of the environment, I'm not sure that's a gamble I'd take.

"9902",2086,"caesarfecit",29,21,1449,45,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case.

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.

&gt;TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 
&gt;

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs. 

Agree with everything else though. As annoying as INPO can be at times, it's certainly better to have it than not."

"9907",1821,"bubba-yo",29,16,34,2,0,"""Yep, the one commonality in every nuclear power accident is that they were preventable.""

And yet they weren't prevented. I'm a firm believer in the safety potential of nuclear, however nuclear power doesn't exist in a theoretical construct - it exists in an economic reality - one which routinely demands concessions in reactor design, in operation, in maintenance, in disposal, and so on. 

Nuclear power is only viable as a safe solution if it's cost competitive with other energy forms. Right now that's coal and natural gas, but in the future it's solar and wind. CA has been working on energy policy and climate change for 40 years - longer than anyone on earth - and the state has decided to shutter it's nuclear plants because we've determined that there's a path to a sustainable grid that doesn't need them. Mandates such as adequate solar capacity on new home construction, likely being extended to whole house batteries, wind and geothermal power, grid-level storage, research across the state into wave energy harvesting, and so on when combined with aggressive conservation (consider that California has reduced it's need for electricity by 50% relative to the rest of the US - if you stop wasting electricity, then you don't need to burn coal to produce the waste) means we don't need to rely on nuclear. 

There are other benefits to this approach. Less transmission losses by generating closer to consumption. More (but also more complex) redundancy in the grid. 

Consider the whole calculation - if CA distributed sufficient rooftop and grid solar, wind, and battery storage across the state to cover 95% of the electricity demand, and needed supplemental power only 5% of the time, what is the most economical way of handling that? It's not a nuclear plant which has relatively long ramp up/down times. It's great for base load, but we don't need base load - we need peaker plants - like this week when we've had a ton of rain and cloud cover. The state has determined that we'd actually be environmentally better off keeping some fossil fuel plants online for this purpose rather than build a modern, safe nuclear plant, If you get their utility down low enough, then it becomes cheaper to carbon capture your emissions than to prevent them in the first place. 

An Allam Cycle natural gas plant (first one has been built in Texas) captures it's own CO2 and has no unburned methane as exhaust. It's about 59% efficient, which includes the capture. And the plants can be relatively small. Now, we don't want to run the entire grid off of such plants because you still have the problems of emissions due to methane leakage and other costs for production and transport, but if you can keep that need down to a minimum, you can better manage it within your economic window. 

The state is also looking to use excess electricity production from renewables (CA is already having to pay AZ and NV to take some of our excess solar production) to power hydrogen production from electrolysis. It's not a terribly efficient process, but if you have too much power on the grid, who cares? Hydrogen becomes another easily storable, transportable fuel that can be used to produce power with no emissions. 

It's the combined approach of all of these things that makes nuclear unviable. Nuclear only really makes sense if you are unwilling to do them."

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

 &gt;Theres lots of dirty energy for us to replace and the world continues to consume more of it. 

Renewables are one of those dirty energy sources. They should be kept to small-scale private endeavors. If Mr.Smith wants to solarize his house, then fine. If Google wants to solarize their HQ, then fine. The main bulk of power generation for our world should absolutely be nuclear."

That's fair enough for your average person chatting shit on Reddit, but people who work 'with electricity' then try to argue from a position of authority and often hilariously wrong. Just as an example, I had a conversation with a grid engineer the other day in work and all his assumptions were way off, he used a capacity factor of 20% for wind, whereas in reality, offshore wind is now hitting 50-60%. His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps. Surplus renewables will then be put to work creating syn-gas/hydrogen or some other derivative to feed into the gas network. Last paragraph is just my opinion, rest is as factual as I could make it."

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "
"10058",413,"filbert227",29,7,412,5,0,"The problem is baseload is a lot more complex than just sending power from one region to another.  The grid may be connected across a pretty large distance but power isn't really sent that far in comparison to the three u.s. grids sizes.  Sending the energy from Arizona where the sun is intense all the way up to Colorado because it's overcast is incredibly inefficient.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I almost forgot...  I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.  Look into dry cask storage and you'll see what I mean.  All the fuel we've used since the plant was commissioned is stored safely on site using this dry cask storage program."

Telling people that ""green won't work"" isn't going to make nuclear happen, it's just going to make coal and natural gas happen.  It's counter-productive.  Nuclear takes too long to build, costs too much up front, and carries too much risk (of being unprofitable due to changing economics, cost overruns, construction delays, etc.  The risk from radioactive material release is very small, but the risk of going bankrupt trying to run a nuclear energy company is huge.)

Nuclear is great in concept but if the target is 2035 then it's a non-starter, it just takes too long to build and commission and nobody wants to take on the financial risk to build new reactors in the private market.  We would have to have a government-run nuclear energy company that built reactors with public funds paid for by a tax on the people to make it actually work, and that's fundamentally opposed to the country's capitalist republic nature.

&gt; Solar/wind will be important components of a future grid makeup, but due to their variability they cannot supply the whole grid, at least until there is a viable storage method available.

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

Hydro doesn't need to be pumped if it's only used as needed to cover fluctuations and base load. This also leaves more water available for agriculture.

It is fortunate that the city later had a number of nuclear reactors constructed around it as that undoubtedly saved untold thousands of lives.

Here a [research paper form 2013](https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=913633).

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

"10168",742,"Backout2allenn",29,8,741,4,0,"A. This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

There's not enough money in pot taxes to eliminate fossil fuel power plants or provide health insurance to all the uninsured or *any* of these ""just use the marijuana money"" comments I see on Reddit."

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

I definitely see both sides to this debate, but nuclear power along with heavy investment in other renewables is possibly our best bet right now.

1. They are expensive as hell and take forever to build. 

2. Theyre permanent, and I dont mean like, theyll be there for a long time permanent. I mean that even after theyre turned off, theyre still there with people monitoring them making sure that they dont melt down for generations.

3. The nuclear waste. With newer technology, this is getting mitigated to smaller and less potent amounts, but its still something that we have to deal with.

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems. It's just to me we need at least one more wave of new plants to keep us with green energy until renewables and battery tech catch up enough to actually manage to work as base load for the nation. (or fusion gets figured out). "
"10286",2042,"onequarterbritish",30,19,13,3,0,"Your points are somewhat valid, but there's some room for accuracy and context.

1. They're expensive, but this is partly due to regulation. Most often nuclear power plants are given permits by the unit, which means that it makes sense to build the biggest unit possible at once to reduce the load from bureaucracy and politics. Smaller, modular power plants would have smaller upfront costs and shorter build times, and the capacity could be increased over time by starting with small capacity, which allows them to start turning profit sooner. Overall nuclear power plants aren't really expensive in the sense that eventually they'll turn out to be very profitable, but it often takes time due to the large size of the plants since from regulation point of view there's little difference between building 10 large plants or 10 small plants. If the regulation changes, this could change too.

For 2. and 3., there's really no need to monitor the plants after decommission. There's waste that needs to be cared for, but when compared to all the other waste production by humankind, nuclear waste is perhaps the least of our worries. Importantly, the waste is extremely dense so volume-wise it's very compact. All of the nuclear waste from spent fuel since the 1950's would fit inside a single football field. Furthermore, there are reactor designs that can reuse spent fuel up to a degree, reducing the amount of final waste further. However, due to being quite a stigmatized field, as well as uranium simply being cheap, there's been little investments towards this technology and its commercialization."

"10313",555,"slipstream808",30,8,4,15,1,"Economically not feasible.  They take way to long to build and too much money.  In this timeframe you end up with cost overruns and delays in schedule.  Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."
"10314",556,"billdietrich1",30,8,4,4,0,"Building new nuclear is a bad idea because:

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc."
"10315",557,"realityChemist",30,8,556,6,0,"To your second point, decentralized generation is a no-go *until* significantly better battery/capacitor tech gets figured out. If you try to implement in the other order, you're going to end up with rolling brown outs as the amount of power and demand both fluctuate dramatically and in an uncorrelated way.

So saying we shouldn't invest in any new nuclear is essentially a gamble that we'll figure the storage problem out before the demand for non-CO2-emitting generation reaches the point where we would have preferred having those nuclear plants. As someone who's spent several years working in advanced electronic materials, and given the current state of the environment, I'm not sure that's a gamble I'd take.

"10331",2086,"caesarfecit",30,21,1449,42,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"10332",2087,"LLJKTympanic",30,21,1449,28,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs. 

Agree with everything else though. As annoying as INPO can be at times, it's certainly better to have it than not."

And yet they weren't prevented. I'm a firm believer in the safety potential of nuclear, however nuclear power doesn't exist in a theoretical construct - it exists in an economic reality - one which routinely demands concessions in reactor design, in operation, in maintenance, in disposal, and so on. 

Nuclear power is only viable as a safe solution if it's cost competitive with other energy forms. Right now that's coal and natural gas, but in the future it's solar and wind. CA has been working on energy policy and climate change for 40 years - longer than anyone on earth - and the state has decided to shutter it's nuclear plants because we've determined that there's a path to a sustainable grid that doesn't need them. Mandates such as adequate solar capacity on new home construction, likely being extended to whole house batteries, wind and geothermal power, grid-level storage, research across the state into wave energy harvesting, and so on when combined with aggressive conservation (consider that California has reduced it's need for electricity by 50% relative to the rest of the US - if you stop wasting electricity, then you don't need to burn coal to produce the waste) means we don't need to rely on nuclear. 

There are other benefits to this approach. Less transmission losses by generating closer to consumption. More (but also more complex) redundancy in the grid. 

Consider the whole calculation - if CA distributed sufficient rooftop and grid solar, wind, and battery storage across the state to cover 95% of the electricity demand, and needed supplemental power only 5% of the time, what is the most economical way of handling that? It's not a nuclear plant which has relatively long ramp up/down times. It's great for base load, but we don't need base load - we need peaker plants - like this week when we've had a ton of rain and cloud cover. The state has determined that we'd actually be environmentally better off keeping some fossil fuel plants online for this purpose rather than build a modern, safe nuclear plant, If you get their utility down low enough, then it becomes cheaper to carbon capture your emissions than to prevent them in the first place. 

An Allam Cycle natural gas plant (first one has been built in Texas) captures it's own CO2 and has no unburned methane as exhaust. It's about 59% efficient, which includes the capture. And the plants can be relatively small. Now, we don't want to run the entire grid off of such plants because you still have the problems of emissions due to methane leakage and other costs for production and transport, but if you can keep that need down to a minimum, you can better manage it within your economic window. 

The state is also looking to use excess electricity production from renewables (CA is already having to pay AZ and NV to take some of our excess solar production) to power hydrogen production from electrolysis. It's not a terribly efficient process, but if you have too much power on the grid, who cares? Hydrogen becomes another easily storable, transportable fuel that can be used to produce power with no emissions. 

It's the combined approach of all of these things that makes nuclear unviable. Nuclear only really makes sense if you are unwilling to do them."

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

That's fair enough for your average person chatting shit on Reddit, but people who work 'with electricity' then try to argue from a position of authority and often hilariously wrong. Just as an example, I had a conversation with a grid engineer the other day in work and all his assumptions were way off, he used a capacity factor of 20% for wind, whereas in reality, offshore wind is now hitting 50-60%. His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps. Surplus renewables will then be put to work creating syn-gas/hydrogen or some other derivative to feed into the gas network. Last paragraph is just my opinion, rest is as factual as I could make it."

"10463",1829,"neuro-grey7",30,16,1828,9,0,"If the city manages to produce more than it uses per year, does it really matter that it's still connected to the grid? That surplus of power gets exported to other locations but regardless, it's still renewable power. Even though as you say, you have no control over where the power comes from, so in theory the city could be using non renewable power, why would that matter? The end goal is 100% renewable power for the US and if the city produces more renewable power than the city uses, isn't that the point? It's a case of the US being a sum of it's parts and getting enough cities to adopt the policy to produce enough for all of the US so Chicago would just be the first step and one part of the whole. I think you're speaking about semantics and what we define as 100% renewable power for a city which isn't the point."
"10464",1831,"gription",30,16,1828,2,0,"You are wrong. Buy the generators and self schedule against your load. This works even in a market. Most of the market is self scheduled anyway. It's not easy, it's not cheap, but it is financially and physically feasible. Just make sure your purchased generation absolutely matches load. How do you deal with no sun or no wind? You buy more of the generation somewhere else in the network and schedule the flows. Like I said, it's not cheap, but it's doable. "
"10465",1832,"kd8azz",30,16,1828,2,1,"(Yes, I know carbon-neutral and renewable are different things, but saying it this way gives me four bullets instead of three.)  I can think of four different definitions of carbon-neutral, when it comes to an electrical grid.

* I buy a kWh worth of carbon offsets for every kWh of electricity I use.
* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.
* Bullet #2, and the carbon-neutral electricity I'm buying is also the geographically closest electricity source, to me, so I'm probably actually using it.
* There are literally zero carbon-burning electricity sources on my grid.


&gt; This is totally impossible without disconnecting from the power grid entirely.

This argues for bullet #4, which is indeed the best.  But I'd argue bullet #3 is probably sufficient.

&gt; How do you think power is being delivered when the sun isnt shining and the wind isnt blowing?

Hopefully storage.  But you're probably right and we're probably back to bullet #2, which is unfortunate.

My house runs on bullet #2.  Bullet #3 can happen with variable pricing and a battery.  If variable pricing was available in my area, I'd buy a battery."
"10466",1833,"gymkhana86",30,16,1832,3,0,"So, your house runs on a ""kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else"", but in reality, it is really produced by a fossil-fuel power plant... seems like you're being scammed.

Storage is the ideal goal, but we are lightyears away from being able to store that much power...

The power company will charge you a premium for providing you with ""renewable energy"" while in reality, your power still comes from the same sources it did before... It's a business tactic... 

"
"10467",1834,"wolfkeeper",30,16,1832,2,0,"If I've understood you correctly, there's another carbon neutral system, where there's (say) solar connected on the grid, and it's owned by a producer, who is being paid by customers, who take their electricity from the grid and get metered in the completely normal way.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

It's green, emissions-wise, but f-ing expensive just to build, let alone to dispose of the waste long-term. Oh, and building a new plant takes a looooong time. 

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "
"10487",413,"filbert227",30,7,412,5,0,"The problem is baseload is a lot more complex than just sending power from one region to another.  The grid may be connected across a pretty large distance but power isn't really sent that far in comparison to the three u.s. grids sizes.  Sending the energy from Arizona where the sun is intense all the way up to Colorado because it's overcast is incredibly inefficient.

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I almost forgot...  I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.  Look into dry cask storage and you'll see what I mean.  All the fuel we've used since the plant was commissioned is stored safely on site using this dry cask storage program."
"10488",1845,"caesarfecit",30,16,412,14,0,"The reason why they take forever to build is because of the regulatory process in most countries, NIMBY bullshit, and the fact that every power station is ""bespoke"" or a unique project.

Telling people that ""green won't work"" isn't going to make nuclear happen, it's just going to make coal and natural gas happen.  It's counter-productive.  Nuclear takes too long to build, costs too much up front, and carries too much risk (of being unprofitable due to changing economics, cost overruns, construction delays, etc.  The risk from radioactive material release is very small, but the risk of going bankrupt trying to run a nuclear energy company is huge.)

Nuclear is great in concept but if the target is 2035 then it's a non-starter, it just takes too long to build and commission and nobody wants to take on the financial risk to build new reactors in the private market.  We would have to have a government-run nuclear energy company that built reactors with public funds paid for by a tax on the people to make it actually work, and that's fundamentally opposed to the country's capitalist republic nature.

It's one thing to cry about how nuclear would save the world, because it would, if we lived in a Trekian utopia, but it's *not going to* and shitting on wind and solar because you're mad nuclear missed the boat is cutting off your nose to spite your face."

Pumped hydro is a great solution, but as you pointed out, there's very little of it and no realistic plans to expand it due to the obscene investment required and volume of land needed.

&gt; Solar/wind will be important components of a future grid makeup, but due to their variability they cannot supply the whole grid, at least until there is a viable storage method available.

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

Hydro doesn't need to be pumped if it's only used as needed to cover fluctuations and base load. This also leaves more water available for agriculture.

Those which require river water for cooling can be restricted by low levels, though this is not very common.

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw.

The entire state of Colorado has only made *almost* a billion dollars in over 5 years. And Colorado has twice as many people as Chicago. www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data

Meanwhile just the residential power usage in America averages 1200 watts (10399 kwh/yr). 
https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

Roughly one million households in Chicago city limits (~2.7 million people in Chicago and the US has an average household size of 2.6) times 1200 watts is 1.2 billion watts. Meanwhile even amazingly cheap renewable energy still costs at least a dollar per watt capacity. So call it $1.2 billion to put Chicago on a 100% renewable power supply.

Thus....even assuming total demand never went above average demand, counting only residential usage, and assuming *insanely* cheap renewable energy (i.e. making  **utterly ridiculous, outright fraudulent** assumptions in favor of pot taxes being enough money) it would still take well over ten years to light up Chicago on their own pot taxes assuming they saw similar per ~~capital~~ capita revenue to Colorado.

I doubt marijuana costs as much of the drug war budget as its percentage of arrests, but I guess we'll assume it does. We also assume here Chicago spending is strictly proportional to national spending per capital.

Then $100 billion * 0.8% * 1/2 is $400 million. In that case sure, the savings on marijuana enforcement can quickly pay for renewable energy in Chicago even without legal marijuana taxes. And you can probably argue discontinuing prohibition increases net government revenue by many times the new tax dollars (although remember regulation and collection will have to be subtracted from your savings on stopping prohibition). 

But again my assumptions for the cost of electrifying Chicago were *completely absurd*. They were utterly rigged to make the pro argument look plausible. And we used the highest number I could find (and it was the highest by a *lot*) to estimate the cost of prohibition."

I definitely see both sides to this debate, but nuclear power along with heavy investment in other renewables is possibly our best bet right now. I only have 3 issues with nuclear power and none of them are radiation getting out and creating flipper babies or Godzillas:

1. They are expensive as hell and take forever to build. 

2. Theyre permanent, and I dont mean like, theyll be there for a long time permanent. I mean that even after theyre turned off, theyre still there with people monitoring them making sure that they dont melt down for generations. Theyll be the medieval cathedrals that we leave future generations. 

3. The nuclear waste. With newer technology, this is getting mitigated to smaller and less potent amounts, but its still something that we have to deal with.

Slight correction on 2 though. Once a plants done you never have to worry about a meltdown (as there's no fuel in the reactor to melt). You do have to watch the spent fuel pool until you can move everything to dry casks (which doesn't take anywhere near generations). Then ideally you'd ship off the dry casks but that isn't happening so you'd have to have security at each site to just guard a parking lot of concrete containers. So you really aren't worried about meltdowns or anything major for very long after a plant shuts down. You just have to make sure people don't come steal dry casks. Which is why ideally you put them all in one or just a couple places. 

Personally I don't see nuclear fission as some great long term solution. It's not. It does have problems. It's just to me we need at least one more wave of new plants to keep us with green energy until renewables and battery tech catch up enough to actually manage to work as base load for the nation. (or fusion gets figured out). "
"10716",2042,"onequarterbritish",31,19,13,3,0,"Your points are somewhat valid, but there's some room for accuracy and context.

1. They're expensive, but this is partly due to regulation. Most often nuclear power plants are given permits by the unit, which means that it makes sense to build the biggest unit possible at once to reduce the load from bureaucracy and politics. Smaller, modular power plants would have smaller upfront costs and shorter build times, and the capacity could be increased over time by starting with small capacity, which allows them to start turning profit sooner. Overall nuclear power plants aren't really expensive in the sense that eventually they'll turn out to be very profitable, but it often takes time due to the large size of the plants since from regulation point of view there's little difference between building 10 large plants or 10 small plants. If the regulation changes, this could change too.

For 2. and 3., there's really no need to monitor the plants after decommission. There's waste that needs to be cared for, but when compared to all the other waste production by humankind, nuclear waste is perhaps the least of our worries. Importantly, the waste is extremely dense so volume-wise it's very compact. All of the nuclear waste from spent fuel since the 1950's would fit inside a single football field. Furthermore, there are reactor designs that can reuse spent fuel up to a degree, reducing the amount of final waste further. However, due to being quite a stigmatized field, as well as uranium simply being cheap, there's been little investments towards this technology and its commercialization."
"10717",2050,"WorBlux",31,20,13,2,0,"1. For current gen reactors in western nations where labor is expensive, this is quite true.  It's not necessarily true of potential future designs.  I think the money is a lot better spent in r+d, and regulatory reform than trying to build  more PWR reactors. "

"10743",555,"slipstream808",31,8,4,10,1,"Economically not feasible.  They take way to long to build and too much money.  In this timeframe you end up with cost overruns and delays in schedule.  Legislation and government change.  Protests.  Things just add up.   I'm going to give you the REAL WORLD United States projects I saw on wikipedia.  Not pipe dream BS about what's possible or what the reactor takes to build because there is a whole site and regulations that need to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent built plant I saw up and running in the US was Watts Bar.   Construction started in 1973 and the first reactor went live in 1996  The second unit completed in 2015.  Costs were 6.1 Billion USD.  Based on when it started I'd say its a late bloomer as a lot of plants were started in the 60s and 70s as nuclear became popular.  Again this is THE MOST recent up and running reactor.  And I havent' found the numbers on it but I'm not sure if the plant is profitable as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Castle is proposed but seems like it'll happen.  Was proposed in 2007.  Costs project 13.4 billion dollars.  But could be upwards of 20 billion due to costs overrun.  They WANT to begin construction in 2023, have the first reactor online in 2028, and the second reactor online in 2030.  So in theory 5 years would be great.  Really I bet it'll be closer to 10.  If you read all the history of nuclear and damnnit just about ANY building of large structures/projects (especially government ones) they just go OVER.  I wouldn't bat an eye if it didn't go live til 2035 once the switch is thrown.  And they guess revenue will be half a billion a year once its all running.  So MAGICAL BEST case scenario if it goes live in 2028 at a cost of 13.4 (round it to 13.5 billion) and that half a million were just to come in then it'll take 27 years to pay off the plant.  Putting possible gains at 2055.  Realistically that wont happen.  Why?

\-Plant wont go live on time.

\-That 500 million is revenue based on 2 reactors not one so at first the revenue will be MUCH lower

\-Taxes

\-Constant overhead for workers, facilities, etc. when the plant is live will eat up some of that revenue

Why do I mention all that?  Nuclear Power plants are investments.  Like this one.  Blue Castle Holdings is doing this so they need to come up with the money somewhere and people want to be paid back.  That or you get massive government subsidies and the citizens pay for it in their tax dollars and then in the power generated.  Still you gotta raise billions.  Nuclear just isn't that profitable taking decades to make back its investment.

The Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station already has a reactor but was proposed and started on units 2 and 3.  But due to (DRUMROLL!) cost overruns and delays AND the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company it was abandoned.  And they already had a site WITH a nuclear reactor built on it.  Again it is a BUSINESS and it needs to make money.

Solar is economically viable that's why it is booming and costs are coming down.  That's why it is being invested in.  Even if you ignore the potential for nuclear disasters (low as they may be there are potentials) and what to do with the wast for the next tens of thousands of years you can't ignore the resources needed.  Nuclear just isn't viable.  If it was we might have more than 1 plant with 2 reactors being built in the US at the moment."
"10744",556,"billdietrich1",31,8,4,4,0,"Building new nuclear is a bad idea because:

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc."
"10745",557,"realityChemist",31,8,556,5,0,"To your second point, decentralized generation is a no-go *until* significantly better battery/capacitor tech gets figured out. If you try to implement in the other order, you're going to end up with rolling brown outs as the amount of power and demand both fluctuate dramatically and in an uncorrelated way.

So saying we shouldn't invest in any new nuclear is essentially a gamble that we'll figure the storage problem out before the demand for non-CO2-emitting generation reaches the point where we would have preferred having those nuclear plants. As someone who's spent several years working in advanced electronic materials, and given the current state of the environment, I'm not sure that's a gamble I'd take.

And Fukushima was 40 year old badly maintained technology with a flawed plant design (underground backup power on a coastal site on a fault line = facepalm) and a foreseeable natural disaster.

"10761",2086,"caesarfecit",31,21,1449,44,0,"TMI was more hysteria than actual disaster.

One of the quirks of light-water based reactors is that they have to be actively cooled or else they can melt down from decay heat alone. And if the reactors suffer a loss of coolant, radioactive steam can start building up, which has to be released or else it can explode. Many new designs sidestep this problem with designs that either don't use water as a working fluid, or are passively safe and don't require active cooling.

Anyway Three Mile Island was a mechanical failure complicated by instrumentation and human error, leading to a loss of coolant accident and a partial meltdown. This meant that the core started to melt but containment wasn't broken. What radioactivity was released was a blast of radioactive gases that everyone thought would have all kinds of horrible side effects and never really did. Nowhere near as bad as Fukushima, and especially Chernobyl.

What people today don't understand is that nuclear energy was even more misunderstood back then and there were popular myths like the China Syndrome (the idea that a reactor could meltdown and keep melting down until it reached China). Everyone thought TMI was a harbinger of more and more severe accidents and that hasn't proven to be the case. What a lot of people don't realize is that nuclear science and especially engineering has advanced quite a bit. "
"10762",2087,"LLJKTympanic",31,21,1449,27,0,"TMI was entirely due to operator error.  Prior to TMI, the NRC was the only authority on nuclear power generation in America.  They relied on the solid engineering of the plants for there safety instead of focusing on training the operators on how the plants actually worked.  

TMI happened because the operators did not understand what the plant was telling them.  They didnt understand what the instruments were telling them.  If the operators had simply done nothing and watched the safety systems operate as they were designed, the meltdown never would have occurred. 

A direct result of TMI was the formation of INPO (institute of nuclear power operations).  The focus of INPO was to be a stricter form of governance than the NRC, an industry run self regulating body that had stricter guidelines for operation than the NRC.  The NRC is the ultimate authority on deciding if a plant can operate, but INPO is there to help ensure that no other accident happens.  They shifted the focus on better training of operators and having better knowledge about the science behind nuclear power generation.  Since TMI, the US nuclear industry has steadily improved in every aspect, primarily in safety and the reliability of the plants.  In the early days of nuclear power, units would shutdown quite frequently due to issues.  Today, many units run 24/7, 365, with the only shutdowns being those that are needed for refueling.

Not to nitpick, but this isn't 100% accurate. If they had simply done nothing, a similar/exact scenario would still have happened. The emergency feed water valves that fed the OTSGs in the event of a loss of normal FW were closed due to poor control of plant equipment back then. So there wouldn't have been any heat transfer outside of makeup/letdown (which would probably have isolated due to the HELB limits or rad alarms, don't remember off the top of my head if this happened automatically then) and steaming the RCS through the reliefs. 

Agree with everything else though. As annoying as INPO can be at times, it's certainly better to have it than not."

And yet they weren't prevented. I'm a firm believer in the safety potential of nuclear, however nuclear power doesn't exist in a theoretical construct - it exists in an economic reality - one which routinely demands concessions in reactor design, in operation, in maintenance, in disposal, and so on. 

Nuclear power is only viable as a safe solution if it's cost competitive with other energy forms. Right now that's coal and natural gas, but in the future it's solar and wind. CA has been working on energy policy and climate change for 40 years - longer than anyone on earth - and the state has decided to shutter it's nuclear plants because we've determined that there's a path to a sustainable grid that doesn't need them. Mandates such as adequate solar capacity on new home construction, likely being extended to whole house batteries, wind and geothermal power, grid-level storage, research across the state into wave energy harvesting, and so on when combined with aggressive conservation (consider that California has reduced it's need for electricity by 50% relative to the rest of the US - if you stop wasting electricity, then you don't need to burn coal to produce the waste) means we don't need to rely on nuclear. 

There are other benefits to this approach. Less transmission losses by generating closer to consumption. More (but also more complex) redundancy in the grid. 

Consider the whole calculation - if CA distributed sufficient rooftop and grid solar, wind, and battery storage across the state to cover 95% of the electricity demand, and needed supplemental power only 5% of the time, what is the most economical way of handling that? It's not a nuclear plant which has relatively long ramp up/down times. It's great for base load, but we don't need base load - we need peaker plants - like this week when we've had a ton of rain and cloud cover. The state has determined that we'd actually be environmentally better off keeping some fossil fuel plants online for this purpose rather than build a modern, safe nuclear plant, If you get their utility down low enough, then it becomes cheaper to carbon capture your emissions than to prevent them in the first place. 

An Allam Cycle natural gas plant (first one has been built in Texas) captures it's own CO2 and has no unburned methane as exhaust. It's about 59% efficient, which includes the capture. And the plants can be relatively small. Now, we don't want to run the entire grid off of such plants because you still have the problems of emissions due to methane leakage and other costs for production and transport, but if you can keep that need down to a minimum, you can better manage it within your economic window. 

The state is also looking to use excess electricity production from renewables (CA is already having to pay AZ and NV to take some of our excess solar production) to power hydrogen production from electrolysis. It's not a terribly efficient process, but if you have too much power on the grid, who cares? Hydrogen becomes another easily storable, transportable fuel that can be used to produce power with no emissions. 

It's the combined approach of all of these things that makes nuclear unviable. Nuclear only really makes sense if you are unwilling to do them."

The only problem with nuclear is how expensive it is to do properly - including building and then decommissioning reactors safely. Hinkly C is on track to be one (if not the) most expensive power plants of any type to be built."

Which is a self-made problem. South Korea, for example, builds their reactors at much lower prices than western countries because they build them in bulk which is highly beneficial in many ways, not only cost related. If every reactor is unique, then not only costs increase drastically because of missing scaling possibility, but also the building itself is prone to failure because of inexperience of those involved (understandably, since its the first -and last- time this unique reactor is built) making delays and even higher costs nearly unavoidable. Its pretty sad, but we westerners have designed us a nice doom loop to make nuclear power less viable.

A nuclear reactor powering a city is just 1 reactor connected to the grid. New reactors can take reprocessed fuel, meaning 0 nuclear waste. They can last at least half a century (modern plants more like 100-150 years) on one ""tank"" of fuel, and nothing needs replacing.

A renewable-powered city is a bunch of solar panels on servo motors, wind turbines, and massive industrial batteries. All of these are more toxic to just produce than nuclear is during its lifetime, and they need to be replaced often. They also generate a ton of pollution to produce, and while they sit there they leak things like Cadmium into the environment. Not to mention the battery stations are pretty much giant bombs.

A nuclear plant scaled down to power a single house is still just 1 nuclear plant. Still lasts the same amount of time as a full scale plant.

A renewables package is still all of those things above. Still toxic. Still expensive. Still needs to be replaced, some parts more often than their upscaled counterparts (smaller battery cells discharge and recharge more, and wear faster). 

Both options are expensive up front. Nuclear pays itself off. Renewables cost the same over time in maintenance and replacement.

Just as an example, I had a conversation with a grid engineer the other day in work and all his assumptions were way off, he used a capacity factor of 20% for wind, whereas in reality, offshore wind is now hitting 50-60%. His solar cost assumption was about 30% too high to. We're building solar this summer for £450k/MW and he was using £700k/MW.

I'm not anti-nuclear, but the UK's ambitious new build nuclear plans are falling apart at the moment and almost everyone has pulled out purely due to construction risk and lack of finance. There's been some insanely dodgy calculations around decommissioning costs too. One group was proposing investing a fraction of the decommission costs in equities and then relying on 8% growth for 50 years to pay for it. If that doesn't materialise as planned, the taxpayer is shit out of luck. It looks like current gen nuclear can now only be built with full capital provided by Government's. But then you've gotta make the case that that should happen when renewables are now being built without subsidy at all. They gave Hinkley C a fixed price of £91/MWh for 35 years. Offshore wind new build is bidding around the £50-60 mark, in-line with wholesale costs. Not only are wind developers not going to need subsidy, they're going to actively pay the Government for use of the sea-bed. This has only emerged in the last 12 months.

Having a continuous dispatachable source of carbon free power is extremely attractive, I think every effort should be made to continue searching for lower risk, cheaper, more modular solutions. But at the moment nuclear is going to get smashed by cheap renewables. I think the most likely solution pathway that will be taken is massively overbuilding renewable capacity and then having dispatchable gas/biomass/hydro/energy from waste to fill in the gaps.

It's the cheaper option going forward. If you insist on building nuclear power plants now and 10 years from now, you'll have to ask the consumers to pay a premium for the electricity.

* I pay for a kWh of carbon-neutral electricity, produced somewhere else and used by someone else, for every kWh of electricity I use.

Now when the sun shines, the solar produces, which shuts down the fossil plants, kWh for kWh. And at night, there's no solar production, so the fossil stuff powers the grid. But the customers of the solar production still get power.

Provided the amount of electricity supplied by the solar producers overall is more than their customers take overall, then that's absolutely fine; and the more solar the producer can install, the more customers they can get to pay for it, and the less pollution is generated.

Eventually, you get to a point where the instantaneous solar power exceeds the demand, and then the producer will have to add storage or whatever, but they can postpone that, by adding wind instead of solar, because the variation adds statistically, in quadrature, rather than linearly, so the sum is less likely to exceed demand. They can also add other sources like biofuels, hydro etc. whatever is available.

That's what my house runs on.

Batteries can also be used, but they're expensive, and best used on the grid side, because they can average out wind+ solar, rather than just averaging out solar within a premises, which has more variability."

Britain just canceled yet another new nuclear power station due to cost overruns, while the largest offshore wind farm is close to completion in the North Sea on time and on budget. I guess if you build enough renewable generation capacity then it will eventually equate to baseload power because the wind will be blowing or sun shining somewhere!

IMO the key to future power security is not necessarily more baseload nuke or fossil stations, but more grid interconnections so renewable power can be sent where it's needed. Or maybe baseload tidal, hydro and geothermal plants, too. "

Hydro is a nice idea, but from what I understand we've capitalized on a lot of what we can tap into already and expansion isn't really that realistic.  Tidal I've heard has issues with corrosion that needs to be dealt with, but I could see tidal as a potential option (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on these points, I heard this info a long time ago).

I would appreciate more info on the geothermal plants, I personally haven't done that much research on them, though at first glance I feel it's kind of hard to scale up tbh.

I do work at a nuke plant.  Part of the issue we're having with being competitive is the unregulated market we're in. This means power companies bid in on how much they *could* sell their power for and still be profitable.  Right now cheap natural gas is effecting these prices, but so is renewables.  Wind and solar often bid in at $0/MWe because their carbon neutral status covers all their expenses with subsidies, while nuclear doesn't get the same edge even though it's also carbon neutral.

At the same time we have been online for almost two years (our entire fuel cycle) without interruption at over 1300 MWe.  Our generator can actually effect grid voltage/kvars on its own in a meaningful way.

Unfortunately I have to go to sleep now, but if you have any questions feel free to post them and I'll answer them sometime tomorrow.

I do agree that nuke plants are very expensive, but if long-term disposal of the spent fuel rods were as big of an issue as people are making it out to be, we would've come up with a new solution.

Nuclear takes too long to build, costs too much up front, and carries too much risk (of being unprofitable due to changing economics, cost overruns, construction delays, etc.  The risk from radioactive material release is very small, but the risk of going bankrupt trying to run a nuclear energy company is huge.)

Nuclear is great in concept but if the target is 2035 then it's a non-starter, it just takes too long to build and commission and nobody wants to take on the financial risk to build new reactors in the private market.  We would have to have a government-run nuclear energy company that built reactors with public funds paid for by a tax on the people to make it actually work, and that's fundamentally opposed to the country's capitalist republic nature.

This overlooks load balancing from conventional hydro. In the northwest we have some solar and quite a bit of wind already installed. These run as they normally would, with the shortfall made up by hydro.

Hydro doesn't need to be pumped if it's only used as needed to cover fluctuations and base load. This also leaves more water available for agriculture.

&gt; Abstract:

&gt; Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a concrete degradation phenomenon in which the alkalis that are typically found in portland cement react with certain amorphous or micro-crystalline siliceous phases in the aggregate and, in the presence of moisture, form an expansive gel that is capable of cracking the concrete and generating macroscopic expansion. As the cracking occurs and progresses, there is a change in the mechanical properties of the concrete. Unfortunately, there is no standard guide or industry best practice for quantifying the reduction in the mechanical properties and the commensurate reduction in the structural capacity of ASR-affected elements. Furthermore, ASR is a complex chemical phenomenon, the rate and extent of which depend upon a number of material and environmental parameters, and the interactions among parameters is not fully understood. Therefore, although there are standardized test methods to characterize the susceptibility of a specific concrete mixture to future ASR degradation, there is no standardized procedure for assuring that a concrete mixture will be entirely immune to ASR throughout its intended service life.

"11025",741,"TheAwakenin",31,8,1,2,1,"Why is the target date so far away? What could be the reason for such a long wait?"
"11026",742,"Backout2allenn",31,8,741,3,0,"A. This is going to be enormously expensive, no city can just spend billions on a totally new project in a year without disrupting normal finances and Chicago already has massive debt. The entire Chicago budget for this year is 8.9 billon. So even if this project could be done for 1 billion (probably way more), you would need the most dangerous city in the country to cut 1 in 9 teachers, cops, ambulances, lawyers, construction dollars, etc. Or the city could raise every tax fine penalty etc by 11%. B. Technology improvements and experience will help build a better more efficient grid over time, if they actually do this I'm sure they will pick strategic geographic areas to work in one by one. No US city is on 100% renewables, It's absurd to think that an optimal immediate plan for converting one of the biggest cities in the world is just gathering dust on a shelf waiting to be used. 
Just because I'm being downvoted here now I'll add: there's no way to put a city as big as Chicago on a 100% nuclear plan without making far bigger batteries than anything we have. Unless the city of chicago is willing to pay tesla or a competitor to dedicate a huge portion production amd R+D to developing a chicago-sized battery-which will likely take years- it's going to be a long and probably error-filled process. Cali said for 10 years they were going to build a high speed train, raised new taxes and borrowed federal cash to raise  $20 of 70 billion needed, then this month decided it can't be done and the money's just spent by the state on other stuff and the taxes are still in placw. These big showy ""improvements"" are often just ""let's throw a bunch of money around and get good PR for a few years, and hope it works out"" "

I dont see how they plan enforcing this. They cant make an electric company make electricity from renevables only, they also cant make their own energy. An electric company doesnt have to provide any electricity to Chicago if it doesnt want to. "
"11032",923,"d1danny",31,9,1,1,0,"Just moved to Chicago a couple of months ago and man are there some visible problems. Fix the pension system to these city workers, fix the potholes correctly instead of doing crappy jobs so city workers can redo it again the next year, do something about the high taxes and for God sakes fix the corruption. It's out in the open and shit still doesn't get done. It's no wonder there's a mass exodus of people. How can you talk about going 100 percent renewable when there's so many other problems the city is going through."

Less pollution is as good thing, but we aren't using renewables to create the products we are using to collect renewables.  Only when we eliminate these plastics and other oil based plastics will I be happy.  Way too much cronyism with the contracts these companies are being given.  This brings up another problem...

France generates 75% of it's power by nuclear power.  It happens to be the most viable mass energy generator for our needs today until we truly harness the power of solar and wind.
