Yes you can.  Anyone can not do something.  If you said ""I can't climb Everest"" you might be right, but anyone can not do a thing.

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

Millenials are Gen-Y (not Gen-Z) and are in their 20s to late 30s in age. Since nearly all smokers start before they are 20, these campaigns are aimed at Gen-Z.

Okay, I *too* have an academic background where the minutia of defined language is important (and is even detail-specific), and too place importance on the non-trivial use of language (being a strong advocate of information ethics). 

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D 

&gt; Society seems to equate the term millenials with anyone not Gen-X (under 40), but it is imperative to distinguish between millenials and gen-z, as they have very different approaches, concerns, needs, and motivating factors. 

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"92",92,"write_as_rayne",1,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations. I think I am extremely salty, because the more I learn, the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late, and it is frustrating. And as an aside, I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers, as its implied. In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience with more than just a few coworkers or a child. That being said, I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong. I think that calling each other out on incorrect assumptions, or in this case, my overreaction to stylistic grammar choices.

You need to let that one go. That isn't a greater reason to pay attention to your cause, and being upset isn't valuable, here. 

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen.

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D 

&gt;  I appreciate that you were able to better articulate that my issue was with the thought more people are going to lump the two generations together, and less to do with the actual use of the word or. Thank you for that, I plan to work to recognize my own misdirection!

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't. They're targeting Gen-Z. The author clearly misused the label of millennial in his article, whether unintentionally (becuase he, likely many people, don't realize how old millennials are) or intentionally (because ""millennial"" drives clicks)."

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

I'm a marketer, and specifically *rely* on people's positivity that they're immune. Sometimes I even plant ideas into advertisements that *overtly tell you* that I'm marketing to you, to distract you from the way you *think* I'm marketing to you (like adding a brand's logo into all reflective surfaces, while you're busy reading my wacky ""this is ironic advertising"" text, or hiring someone to talk affirmatively to people in the comment section on Reddit, when people are turning one of my ads into an ironic meme).

I'm actually an advocate for *social* responsibility, in the ""it takes a village to raise a child"" sense. I don't dismiss the harm (*or* ownership) that comes from failing to talk to friends and peers about this sort of thing, or how it's a problem. 

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke. 

Not just 'not a negative', but an actual positive.

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

"170",170,"arconreef",1,1,169,1,0,"The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame. They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products. That's what corporations do.

It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make, but it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption. In my view that is a very misguided and futile venture on the same level as abstinence only sex ed. Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do.

"171",171,"SnakeAndTheApple",1,1,170,1,0,"&gt; The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

&gt; I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make

The point I'm making is straight-forward, and I'm not using round-about language. I'm pretty direct in what I say. 

&gt; it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking. 

I don't think you're the expert to be listening to, and your motives/ethics seem to be a bit suspect. "

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

Okay, I *too* have an academic background where the minutia of defined language is important (and is even detail-specific), and too place importance on the non-trivial use of language (being a strong advocate of information ethics). 

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D 

&gt; Society seems to equate the term millenials with anyone not Gen-X (under 40), but it is imperative to distinguish between millenials and gen-z, as they have very different approaches, concerns, needs, and motivating factors. 

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"304",92,"write_as_rayne",2,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations. I think I am extremely salty, because the more I learn, the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late, and it is frustrating. And as an aside, I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers, as its implied. In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience with more than just a few coworkers or a child.

You need to let that one go. That isn't a greater reason to pay attention to your cause, and being upset isn't valuable, here. 

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D 

&gt;  I appreciate that you were able to better articulate that my issue was with the thought more people are going to lump the two generations together, and less to do with the actual use of the word or. Thank you for that, I plan to work to recognize my own misdirection!

"306",94,"Kraz31",2,1,89,1,0,"And this is where context is important.

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't. They're targeting Gen-Z. The author clearly misused the label of millennial in his article, whether unintentionally (becuase he, likely many people, don't realize how old millennials are) or intentionally (because ""millennial"" drives clicks)."
"307",95,"SnakeAndTheApple",2,1,94,1,0,"&gt; The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "
"308",96,"Kraz31",2,1,95,2,0,"&gt; That is incorrect

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

I'm actually an advocate for *social* responsibility, in the ""it takes a village to raise a child"" sense. I don't dismiss the harm (*or* ownership) that comes from failing to talk to friends and peers about this sort of thing, or how it's a problem. 

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke. 

Not just 'not a negative', but an actual positive. 

&gt;  If you wanna look cool at the expense of your health then its probably not the only thing youd do to look cool at the expense of your health.

I care about my friends, wouldn't want them to hurt themselves, and don't think they should suffer through bad choices just because I never stepped up to do anything about it.

seems pretty obvious to me, having been raised under a generation that had to see a lot of the harms of smoking first-hand through my grandparents, uncles, and aunts

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make, but it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption.

"383",171,"SnakeAndTheApple",2,1,170,1,0,"&gt; The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

The point I'm making is straight-forward, and I'm not using round-about language. I'm pretty direct in what I say. 

&gt; it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking.

Yes you can.  Anyone can not do something.  If you said ""I can't climb Everest"" you might be right, but anyone can not do a thing.

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

Okay, I *too* have an academic background where the minutia of defined language is important (and is even detail-specific), and too place importance on the non-trivial use of language (being a strong advocate of information ethics). 

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D 

&gt; Society seems to equate the term millenials with anyone not Gen-X (under 40), but it is imperative to distinguish between millenials and gen-z, as they have very different approaches, concerns, needs, and motivating factors. 

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"516",92,"write_as_rayne",3,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations. I think I am extremely salty, because the more I learn, the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late, and it is frustrating. And as an aside, I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers, as its implied.

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't. They're targeting Gen-Z. The author clearly misused the label of millennial in his article, whether unintentionally (becuase he, likely many people, don't realize how old millennials are) or intentionally (because ""millennial"" drives clicks)."

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

I'm a marketer, and specifically *rely* on people's positivity that they're immune. Sometimes I even plant ideas into advertisements that *overtly tell you* that I'm marketing to you, to distract you from the way you *think* I'm marketing to you (like adding a brand's logo into all reflective surfaces, while you're busy reading my wacky ""this is ironic advertising"" text, or hiring someone to talk affirmatively to people in the comment section on Reddit, when people are turning one of my ads into an ironic meme).

I'm actually an advocate for *social* responsibility, in the ""it takes a village to raise a child"" sense. I don't dismiss the harm (*or* ownership) that comes from failing to talk to friends and peers about this sort of thing, or how it's a problem. 

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke. 

Not just 'not a negative', but an actual positive.

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

In my view that is a very misguided and futile venture on the same level as abstinence only sex ed. Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale."
"595",171,"SnakeAndTheApple",3,1,170,1,0,"&gt; The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

&gt; I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make

The point I'm making is straight-forward, and I'm not using round-about language. I'm pretty direct in what I say. 

&gt; it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking. 

I don't think you're the expert to be listening to, and your motives/ethics seem to be a bit suspect. "

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

Okay, I *too* have an academic background where the minutia of defined language is important (and is even detail-specific), and too place importance on the non-trivial use of language (being a strong advocate of information ethics). 

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D 

&gt; Society seems to equate the term millenials with anyone not Gen-X (under 40), but it is imperative to distinguish between millenials and gen-z, as they have very different approaches, concerns, needs, and motivating factors. 

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"729",92,"write_as_rayne",4,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations. I think I am extremely salty, because the more I learn, the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late, and it is frustrating. And as an aside, I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers, as its implied. In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience with more than just a few coworkers or a child.

You need to let that one go. That isn't a greater reason to pay attention to your cause, and being upset isn't valuable, here. 

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D 

&gt;  I appreciate that you were able to better articulate that my issue was with the thought more people are going to lump the two generations together, and less to do with the actual use of the word or. Thank you for that, I plan to work to recognize my own misdirection!

"731",94,"Kraz31",4,1,89,1,0,"And this is where context is important.

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't. They're targeting Gen-Z. The author clearly misused the label of millennial in his article, whether unintentionally (becuase he, likely many people, don't realize how old millennials are) or intentionally (because ""millennial"" drives clicks)."
"732",95,"SnakeAndTheApple",4,1,94,1,0,"&gt; The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "
"733",96,"Kraz31",4,1,95,2,0,"&gt; That is incorrect

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

I'm actually an advocate for *social* responsibility, in the ""it takes a village to raise a child"" sense. I don't dismiss the harm (*or* ownership) that comes from failing to talk to friends and peers about this sort of thing, or how it's a problem. 

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke. 

Not just 'not a negative', but an actual positive. 

&gt;  If you wanna look cool at the expense of your health then its probably not the only thing youd do to look cool at the expense of your health.

I care about my friends, wouldn't want them to hurt themselves, and don't think they should suffer through bad choices just because I never stepped up to do anything about it.

seems pretty obvious to me, having been raised under a generation that had to see a lot of the harms of smoking first-hand through my grandparents, uncles, and aunts

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make, but it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption.

"808",171,"SnakeAndTheApple",4,1,170,1,0,"&gt; The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

The point I'm making is straight-forward, and I'm not using round-about language. I'm pretty direct in what I say. 

&gt; it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking.

Yes you can.  Anyone can not do something.  If you said ""I can't climb Everest"" you might be right, but anyone can not do a thing.

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

Okay, I *too* have an academic background where the minutia of defined language is important (and is even detail-specific), and too place importance on the non-trivial use of language (being a strong advocate of information ethics). 

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D 

&gt; Society seems to equate the term millenials with anyone not Gen-X (under 40), but it is imperative to distinguish between millenials and gen-z, as they have very different approaches, concerns, needs, and motivating factors. 

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"942",92,"write_as_rayne",5,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations. I think I am extremely salty, because the more I learn, the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late, and it is frustrating. And as an aside, I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers, as its implied. In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience with more than just a few coworkers or a child.

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D 

&gt;  I appreciate that you were able to better articulate that my issue was with the thought more people are going to lump the two generations together, and less to do with the actual use of the word or. Thank you for that, I plan to work to recognize my own misdirection! 

We're very clearly disagreeing, but I'm enjoying this conversation a lot. :D

"944",94,"Kraz31",5,1,89,1,0,"And this is where context is important. The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free **Kids,** the investigation talks about tobacco companies targeting the ""next generation"" and ""America's youth,"" and the petition the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids submitted to the FTC specifically talks about protecting kids and young people (i.e. teens).

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't. They're targeting Gen-Z. The author clearly misused the label of millennial in his article, whether unintentionally (becuase he, likely many people, don't realize how old millennials are) or intentionally (because ""millennial"" drives clicks)."

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

I'm a marketer, and specifically *rely* on people's positivity that they're immune. Sometimes I even plant ideas into advertisements that *overtly tell you* that I'm marketing to you, to distract you from the way you *think* I'm marketing to you (like adding a brand's logo into all reflective surfaces, while you're busy reading my wacky ""this is ironic advertising"" text, or hiring someone to talk affirmatively to people in the comment section on Reddit, when people are turning one of my ads into an ironic meme).

I am ad-aware to the point of owning virtually nothing. my total worth is 3k. also your idea of advertising in a way people dont expect only works on those who think they know how you are trying to sell something. i take the stance that everything is an attempt to sell me something, therefore buy nothing and trust no media of any kind. i dont even buy things based on the opinions of people i know, chances are they have been manipulated in some way.

I'm actually an advocate for *social* responsibility, in the ""it takes a village to raise a child"" sense. I don't dismiss the harm (*or* ownership) that comes from failing to talk to friends and peers about this sort of thing, or how it's a problem. 

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke. 

Not just 'not a negative', but an actual positive.

I care about my friends, wouldn't want them to hurt themselves, and don't think they should suffer through bad choices just because I never stepped up to do anything about it.

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

&gt; A corporation gets it's orders from it's shareholders, and the shareholders always say the same thing: make us money. At any cost.

okay, but i think you might be speaking passionately, while trying to distract from the topic at hand"
"1020",170,"arconreef",5,1,169,1,0,"The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame. They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products. That's what corporations do. They could not do anything other than what they are doing. It's how they were designed to function.

It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make, but it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption. In my view that is a very misguided and futile venture on the same level as abstinence only sex ed. Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale."
"1021",171,"SnakeAndTheApple",5,1,170,1,0,"&gt; The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

&gt; I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make

The point I'm making is straight-forward, and I'm not using round-about language. I'm pretty direct in what I say. 

&gt; it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking. 

I don't think you're the expert to be listening to, and your motives/ethics seem to be a bit suspect. "

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

Okay, I *too* have an academic background where the minutia of defined language is important (and is even detail-specific), and too place importance on the non-trivial use of language (being a strong advocate of information ethics). 

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D 

&gt; Society seems to equate the term millenials with anyone not Gen-X (under 40), but it is imperative to distinguish between millenials and gen-z, as they have very different approaches, concerns, needs, and motivating factors. 

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"1155",92,"write_as_rayne",6,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations. I think I am extremely salty, because the more I learn, the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late, and it is frustrating. And as an aside, I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers, as its implied. In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience with more than just a few coworkers or a child.

You need to let that one go. That isn't a greater reason to pay attention to your cause, and being upset isn't valuable, here. 

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D 

&gt;  I appreciate that you were able to better articulate that my issue was with the thought more people are going to lump the two generations together, and less to do with the actual use of the word or. Thank you for that, I plan to work to recognize my own misdirection!

"1157",94,"Kraz31",6,1,89,1,0,"And this is where context is important.

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't. They're targeting Gen-Z. The author clearly misused the label of millennial in his article, whether unintentionally (becuase he, likely many people, don't realize how old millennials are) or intentionally (because ""millennial"" drives clicks)."
"1158",95,"SnakeAndTheApple",6,1,94,1,0,"&gt; The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "
"1159",96,"Kraz31",6,1,95,2,0,"&gt; That is incorrect

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

Sometimes I even plant ideas into advertisements that *overtly tell you* that I'm marketing to you, to distract you from the way you *think* I'm marketing to you (like adding a brand's logo into all reflective surfaces, while you're busy reading my wacky ""this is ironic advertising"" text, or hiring someone to talk affirmatively to people in the comment section on Reddit, when people are turning one of my ads into an ironic meme). 

If you think you can't be hit by ads because you're ad-aware, you're wrong. Being ad-aware is your recognizing you're basically completely vulnerable to influence, even when you're attentive for it. "

I am ad-aware to the point of owning virtually nothing. my total worth is 3k. also your idea of advertising in a way people dont expect only works on those who think they know how you are trying to sell something. i take the stance that everything is an attempt to sell me something, therefore buy nothing and trust no media of any kind. i dont even buy things based on the opinions of people i know, chances are they have been manipulated in some way.

I'm actually an advocate for *social* responsibility, in the ""it takes a village to raise a child"" sense. I don't dismiss the harm (*or* ownership) that comes from failing to talk to friends and peers about this sort of thing, or how it's a problem. 

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke. 

Not just 'not a negative', but an actual positive. 

&gt;  If you wanna look cool at the expense of your health then its probably not the only thing youd do to look cool at the expense of your health.

I care about my friends, wouldn't want them to hurt themselves, and don't think they should suffer through bad choices just because I never stepped up to do anything about it.

Non-smoker here. Nicotine is a stimulant and in large doses actually has some psychoactive effects. I tried my young cousin's JUUL once and can confirm, that shit is *drugs*. Saying ""there are no benefits to smoking"" is like saying the same thing about drinking, or any other substance used as a drug.

seems pretty obvious to me, having been raised under a generation that had to see a lot of the harms of smoking first-hand through my grandparents, uncles, and aunts

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make, but it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking.

Yes you can.  Anyone can not do something.  If you said ""I can't climb Everest"" you might be right, but anyone can not do a thing.

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

Okay, I *too* have an academic background where the minutia of defined language is important (and is even detail-specific), and too place importance on the non-trivial use of language (being a strong advocate of information ethics). 

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D 

&gt; Society seems to equate the term millenials with anyone not Gen-X (under 40), but it is imperative to distinguish between millenials and gen-z, as they have very different approaches, concerns, needs, and motivating factors. 

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"1368",92,"write_as_rayne",7,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together.

The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations.

We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D 

&gt;  I appreciate that you were able to better articulate that my issue was with the thought more people are going to lump the two generations together, and less to do with the actual use of the word or. Thank you for that, I plan to work to recognize my own misdirection! 

We're very clearly disagreeing, but I'm enjoying this conversation a lot. :D 

*Edit because I'd incorrectly interchanged 'Generation X' with 'Generation Z' accidentally."
"1370",94,"Kraz31",7,1,89,1,0,"And this is where context is important. The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free **Kids,** the investigation talks about tobacco companies targeting the ""next generation"" and ""America's youth,"" and the petition the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids submitted to the FTC specifically talks about protecting kids and young people (i.e. teens).

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't. They're targeting Gen-Z. The author clearly misused the label of millennial in his article, whether unintentionally (becuase he, likely many people, don't realize how old millennials are) or intentionally (because ""millennial"" drives clicks)."
"1371",95,"SnakeAndTheApple",7,1,94,1,0,"&gt; The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "
"1372",96,"Kraz31",7,1,95,2,0,"&gt; That is incorrect

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

I'm a marketer, and specifically *rely* on people's positivity that they're immune. Sometimes I even plant ideas into advertisements that *overtly tell you* that I'm marketing to you, to distract you from the way you *think* I'm marketing to you (like adding a brand's logo into all reflective surfaces, while you're busy reading my wacky ""this is ironic advertising"" text, or hiring someone to talk affirmatively to people in the comment section on Reddit, when people are turning one of my ads into an ironic meme).

I'm actually an advocate for *social* responsibility, in the ""it takes a village to raise a child"" sense. I don't dismiss the harm (*or* ownership) that comes from failing to talk to friends and peers about this sort of thing, or how it's a problem. 

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke.

If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure. The current structure is modeled after the military.

"1445",169,"SnakeAndTheApple",7,1,168,2,1,"&gt;  I don't understand why anyone is surprised or upset that tobacco corporations are trying to sell their product.

seems pretty obvious to me, having been raised under a generation that had to see a lot of the harms of smoking first-hand through my grandparents, uncles, and aunts

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

&gt; A corporation gets it's orders from it's shareholders, and the shareholders always say the same thing: make us money. At any cost.

"1446",170,"arconreef",7,1,169,1,0,"The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame. They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products. That's what corporations do. They could not do anything other than what they are doing. It's how they were designed to function.

It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make, but it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption. In my view that is a very misguided and futile venture on the same level as abstinence only sex ed. Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale."
"1447",171,"SnakeAndTheApple",7,1,170,1,0,"&gt; The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

&gt; I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make

The point I'm making is straight-forward, and I'm not using round-about language. I'm pretty direct in what I say. 

&gt; it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking. 

I don't think you're the expert to be listening to, and your motives/ethics seem to be a bit suspect. "

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

Okay, I *too* have an academic background where the minutia of defined language is important (and is even detail-specific), and too place importance on the non-trivial use of language (being a strong advocate of information ethics). 

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D 

&gt; Society seems to equate the term millenials with anyone not Gen-X (under 40), but it is imperative to distinguish between millenials and gen-z, as they have very different approaches, concerns, needs, and motivating factors. 

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"1581",92,"write_as_rayne",8,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations. I think I am extremely salty, because the more I learn, the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late, and it is frustrating. And as an aside, I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers, as its implied.

You need to let that one go. That isn't a greater reason to pay attention to your cause, and being upset isn't valuable, here. 

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D 

&gt;  I appreciate that you were able to better articulate that my issue was with the thought more people are going to lump the two generations together, and less to do with the actual use of the word or. Thank you for that, I plan to work to recognize my own misdirection!

"1583",94,"Kraz31",8,1,89,1,0,"And this is where context is important.

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't. They're targeting Gen-Z.

"1584",95,"SnakeAndTheApple",8,1,94,1,0,"&gt; The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "
"1585",96,"Kraz31",8,1,95,2,0,"&gt; That is incorrect

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

I'm a marketer, and specifically *rely* on people's positivity that they're immune. Sometimes I even plant ideas into advertisements that *overtly tell you* that I'm marketing to you, to distract you from the way you *think* I'm marketing to you (like adding a brand's logo into all reflective surfaces, while you're busy reading my wacky ""this is ironic advertising"" text, or hiring someone to talk affirmatively to people in the comment section on Reddit, when people are turning one of my ads into an ironic meme).

I'm actually an advocate for *social* responsibility, in the ""it takes a village to raise a child"" sense. I don't dismiss the harm (*or* ownership) that comes from failing to talk to friends and peers about this sort of thing, or how it's a problem. 

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke. 

Not just 'not a negative', but an actual positive.

seems pretty obvious to me, having been raised under a generation that had to see a lot of the harms of smoking first-hand through my grandparents, uncles, and aunts

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking.

Yes you can.  Anyone can not do something.  If you said ""I can't climb Everest"" you might be right, but anyone can not do a thing.

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

Okay, I *too* have an academic background where the minutia of defined language is important (and is even detail-specific), and too place importance on the non-trivial use of language (being a strong advocate of information ethics). 

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"1794",92,"write_as_rayne",9,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations. I think I am extremely salty, because the more I learn, the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late, and it is frustrating. And as an aside, I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers, as its implied. In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience with more than just a few coworkers or a child.

You need to let that one go. That isn't a greater reason to pay attention to your cause, and being upset isn't valuable, here. 

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D 

&gt;  I appreciate that you were able to better articulate that my issue was with the thought more people are going to lump the two generations together, and less to do with the actual use of the word or. Thank you for that, I plan to work to recognize my own misdirection! 

We're very clearly disagreeing, but I'm enjoying this conversation a lot. :D 

*Edit because I'd incorrectly interchanged 'Generation X' with 'Generation Z' accidentally."
"1796",94,"Kraz31",9,1,89,1,0,"And this is where context is important. The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free **Kids,** the investigation talks about tobacco companies targeting the ""next generation"" and ""America's youth,"" and the petition the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids submitted to the FTC specifically talks about protecting kids and young people (i.e. teens).

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't. They're targeting Gen-Z. The author clearly misused the label of millennial in his article, whether unintentionally (becuase he, likely many people, don't realize how old millennials are) or intentionally (because ""millennial"" drives clicks)."
"1797",95,"SnakeAndTheApple",9,1,94,1,0,"&gt; The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "
"1798",96,"Kraz31",9,1,95,2,0,"&gt; That is incorrect 

Check your facts man, I'll even give you a source: [https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data\_statistics/fact\_sheets/youth\_data/tobacco\_use/index.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/youth_data/tobacco_use/index.htm)

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

I'm a marketer, and specifically *rely* on people's positivity that they're immune.

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke.

"1871",169,"SnakeAndTheApple",9,1,168,3,1,"&gt;  I don't understand why anyone is surprised or upset that tobacco corporations are trying to sell their product.

seems pretty obvious to me, having been raised under a generation that had to see a lot of the harms of smoking first-hand through my grandparents, uncles, and aunts

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

&gt; A corporation gets it's orders from it's shareholders, and the shareholders always say the same thing: make us money. At any cost.

okay, but i think you might be speaking passionately, while trying to distract from the topic at hand"
"1872",170,"arconreef",9,1,169,1,0,"The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame. They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products. That's what corporations do. They could not do anything other than what they are doing. It's how they were designed to function.

It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make, but it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption. In my view that is a very misguided and futile venture on the same level as abstinence only sex ed. Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale."
"1873",171,"SnakeAndTheApple",9,1,170,1,0,"&gt; The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

&gt; I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make

The point I'm making is straight-forward, and I'm not using round-about language. I'm pretty direct in what I say. 

&gt; it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking. 

I don't think you're the expert to be listening to, and your motives/ethics seem to be a bit suspect. "

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

Millenials are Gen-Y (not Gen-Z) and are in their 20s to late 30s in age. Since nearly all smokers start before they are 20, these campaigns are aimed at Gen-Z. They don't have a trendy nickname (although iGen and Post-Millenial are used) and are mostly under 20 (+/-  a few years depending on who you ask)."

Okay, I *too* have an academic background where the minutia of defined language is important (and is even detail-specific), and too place importance on the non-trivial use of language (being a strong advocate of information ethics). 

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D 

&gt; Society seems to equate the term millenials with anyone not Gen-X (under 40), but it is imperative to distinguish between millenials and gen-z, as they have very different approaches, concerns, needs, and motivating factors. 

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"2007",92,"write_as_rayne",10,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations. I think I am extremely salty, because the more I learn, the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late, and it is frustrating. And as an aside, I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers, as its implied.

You need to let that one go. That isn't a greater reason to pay attention to your cause, and being upset isn't valuable, here. 

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D 

&gt;  I appreciate that you were able to better articulate that my issue was with the thought more people are going to lump the two generations together, and less to do with the actual use of the word or. Thank you for that, I plan to work to recognize my own misdirection! 

We're very clearly disagreeing, but I'm enjoying this conversation a lot. :D

"2009",94,"Kraz31",10,1,89,1,0,"And this is where context is important.

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't. They're targeting Gen-Z.

"2010",95,"SnakeAndTheApple",10,1,94,1,0,"&gt; The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "
"2011",96,"Kraz31",10,1,95,2,0,"&gt; That is incorrect

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

I'm a marketer, and specifically *rely* on people's positivity that they're immune.

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke.

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking.

Yes you can.  Anyone can not do something.  If you said ""I can't climb Everest"" you might be right, but anyone can not do a thing.

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"2221",92,"write_as_rayne",11,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations. I think I am extremely salty, because the more I learn, the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late, and it is frustrating.

You need to let that one go. That isn't a greater reason to pay attention to your cause, and being upset isn't valuable, here. 

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't. They're targeting Gen-Z.

"2224",95,"SnakeAndTheApple",11,1,94,1,0,"&gt; The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "
"2225",96,"Kraz31",11,1,95,2,0,"&gt; That is incorrect

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking.

Non-smoker here. Nicotine is a stimulant and in large doses actually has some psychoactive effects. I tried my young cousin's JUUL once and can confirm, that shit is *drugs*. Saying ""there are no benefits to smoking"" is like saying the same thing about drinking, or any other substance used as a drug.

seems pretty obvious to me, having been raised under a generation that had to see a lot of the harms of smoking first-hand through my grandparents, uncles, and aunts

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make, but it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption.

"2300",171,"SnakeAndTheApple",11,1,170,1,0,"&gt; The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

&gt; I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make

The point I'm making is straight-forward, and I'm not using round-about language. I'm pretty direct in what I say. 

&gt; it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking. 

I don't think you're the expert to be listening to, and your motives/ethics seem to be a bit suspect. "

Yes you can.  Anyone can not do something.  If you said ""I can't climb Everest"" you might be right, but anyone can not do a thing.

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"2435",92,"write_as_rayne",12,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations.

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "
"2439",96,"Kraz31",12,1,95,2,0,"&gt; That is incorrect 

Check your facts man, I'll even give you a source: [https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data\_statistics/fact\_sheets/youth\_data/tobacco\_use/index.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/youth_data/tobacco_use/index.htm)

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)). Another investigation in 22 countries by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids [found cigarette product placement around primary and secondary schools](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/09/how-children-around-the-world-are-exposed-to-cigarette-advertising). In summary, for the third time, the goal of big tobacco's social media campaign is to target Gen-Z."

I'm a marketer, and specifically *rely* on people's positivity that they're immune. Sometimes I even plant ideas into advertisements that *overtly tell you* that I'm marketing to you, to distract you from the way you *think* I'm marketing to you (like adding a brand's logo into all reflective surfaces, while you're busy reading my wacky ""this is ironic advertising"" text, or hiring someone to talk affirmatively to people in the comment section on Reddit, when people are turning one of my ads into an ironic meme).

I'm actually an advocate for *social* responsibility, in the ""it takes a village to raise a child"" sense. I don't dismiss the harm (*or* ownership) that comes from failing to talk to friends and peers about this sort of thing, or how it's a problem. 

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke.

seems pretty obvious to me, having been raised under a generation that had to see a lot of the harms of smoking first-hand through my grandparents, uncles, and aunts

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

&gt; I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make

The point I'm making is straight-forward, and I'm not using round-about language. I'm pretty direct in what I say. 

&gt; it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking. 

I don't think you're the expert to be listening to, and your motives/ethics seem to be a bit suspect. "

Yes you can.  Anyone can not do something.  If you said ""I can't climb Everest"" you might be right, but anyone can not do a thing.

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"2649",92,"write_as_rayne",13,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations.

You need to let that one go. That isn't a greater reason to pay attention to your cause, and being upset isn't valuable, here. 

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D 

&gt;  I appreciate that you were able to better articulate that my issue was with the thought more people are going to lump the two generations together, and less to do with the actual use of the word or. Thank you for that, I plan to work to recognize my own misdirection!

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't. They're targeting Gen-Z. The author clearly misused the label of millennial in his article, whether unintentionally (becuase he, likely many people, don't realize how old millennials are) or intentionally (because ""millennial"" drives clicks)."
"2652",95,"SnakeAndTheApple",13,1,94,1,0,"&gt; The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "
"2653",96,"Kraz31",13,1,95,2,0,"&gt; That is incorrect

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

I'm actually an advocate for *social* responsibility, in the ""it takes a village to raise a child"" sense. I don't dismiss the harm (*or* ownership) that comes from failing to talk to friends and peers about this sort of thing, or how it's a problem. 

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke. 

Not just 'not a negative', but an actual positive. 

&gt;  If you wanna look cool at the expense of your health then its probably not the only thing youd do to look cool at the expense of your health.

I care about my friends, wouldn't want them to hurt themselves, and don't think they should suffer through bad choices just because I never stepped up to do anything about it.

seems pretty obvious to me, having been raised under a generation that had to see a lot of the harms of smoking first-hand through my grandparents, uncles, and aunts

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make, but it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking.

Yes you can.  Anyone can not do something.  If you said ""I can't climb Everest"" you might be right, but anyone can not do a thing.

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

Okay, I *too* have an academic background where the minutia of defined language is important (and is even detail-specific), and too place importance on the non-trivial use of language (being a strong advocate of information ethics). 

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"2862",92,"write_as_rayne",14,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations.

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy.

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D 

&gt;  I appreciate that you were able to better articulate that my issue was with the thought more people are going to lump the two generations together, and less to do with the actual use of the word or. Thank you for that, I plan to work to recognize my own misdirection! 

We're very clearly disagreeing, but I'm enjoying this conversation a lot. :D 

*Edit because I'd incorrectly interchanged 'Generation X' with 'Generation Z' accidentally."
"2864",94,"Kraz31",14,1,89,1,0,"And this is where context is important. The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free **Kids,** the investigation talks about tobacco companies targeting the ""next generation"" and ""America's youth,"" and the petition the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids submitted to the FTC specifically talks about protecting kids and young people (i.e. teens).

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't. They're targeting Gen-Z. The author clearly misused the label of millennial in his article, whether unintentionally (becuase he, likely many people, don't realize how old millennials are) or intentionally (because ""millennial"" drives clicks)."
"2865",95,"SnakeAndTheApple",14,1,94,1,0,"&gt; The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "
"2866",96,"Kraz31",14,1,95,2,0,"&gt; That is incorrect

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

I'm a marketer, and specifically *rely* on people's positivity that they're immune. Sometimes I even plant ideas into advertisements that *overtly tell you* that I'm marketing to you, to distract you from the way you *think* I'm marketing to you (like adding a brand's logo into all reflective surfaces, while you're busy reading my wacky ""this is ironic advertising"" text, or hiring someone to talk affirmatively to people in the comment section on Reddit, when people are turning one of my ads into an ironic meme).

I'm actually an advocate for *social* responsibility, in the ""it takes a village to raise a child"" sense. I don't dismiss the harm (*or* ownership) that comes from failing to talk to friends and peers about this sort of thing, or how it's a problem. 

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke.

If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure. The current structure is modeled after the military. Military structure is designed to diffuse responsibility so that nobody questions their orders, no matter how abhorrent they may seem. A corporation gets it's orders from it's shareholders, and the shareholders always say the same thing: make us money. At any cost."
"2939",169,"SnakeAndTheApple",14,1,168,2,1,"&gt;  I don't understand why anyone is surprised or upset that tobacco corporations are trying to sell their product.

seems pretty obvious to me, having been raised under a generation that had to see a lot of the harms of smoking first-hand through my grandparents, uncles, and aunts

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

&gt; A corporation gets it's orders from it's shareholders, and the shareholders always say the same thing: make us money. At any cost.

okay, but i think you might be speaking passionately, while trying to distract from the topic at hand"
"2940",170,"arconreef",14,1,169,1,0,"The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame. They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products. That's what corporations do. They could not do anything other than what they are doing. It's how they were designed to function.

It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make, but it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption. In my view that is a very misguided and futile venture on the same level as abstinence only sex ed. Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

"2941",171,"SnakeAndTheApple",14,1,170,1,0,"&gt; The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

&gt; I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make

The point I'm making is straight-forward, and I'm not using round-about language. I'm pretty direct in what I say. 

&gt; it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking. 

I don't think you're the expert to be listening to, and your motives/ethics seem to be a bit suspect. "

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

Okay, I *too* have an academic background where the minutia of defined language is important (and is even detail-specific), and too place importance on the non-trivial use of language (being a strong advocate of information ethics). 

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D 

&gt; Society seems to equate the term millenials with anyone not Gen-X (under 40), but it is imperative to distinguish between millenials and gen-z, as they have very different approaches, concerns, needs, and motivating factors. 

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"3075",92,"write_as_rayne",15,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations. I think I am extremely salty, because the more I learn, the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late, and it is frustrating.

You need to let that one go. That isn't a greater reason to pay attention to your cause, and being upset isn't valuable, here. 

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D 

&gt;  I appreciate that you were able to better articulate that my issue was with the thought more people are going to lump the two generations together, and less to do with the actual use of the word or. Thank you for that, I plan to work to recognize my own misdirection!

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't.

"3078",95,"SnakeAndTheApple",15,1,94,1,0,"&gt; The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "
"3079",96,"Kraz31",15,1,95,2,0,"&gt; That is incorrect

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

I'm a marketer, and specifically *rely* on people's positivity that they're immune. Sometimes I even plant ideas into advertisements that *overtly tell you* that I'm marketing to you, to distract you from the way you *think* I'm marketing to you (like adding a brand's logo into all reflective surfaces, while you're busy reading my wacky ""this is ironic advertising"" text, or hiring someone to talk affirmatively to people in the comment section on Reddit, when people are turning one of my ads into an ironic meme).

I'm actually an advocate for *social* responsibility, in the ""it takes a village to raise a child"" sense. I don't dismiss the harm (*or* ownership) that comes from failing to talk to friends and peers about this sort of thing, or how it's a problem. 

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke.

seems pretty obvious to me, having been raised under a generation that had to see a lot of the harms of smoking first-hand through my grandparents, uncles, and aunts

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking.

Yes you can.  Anyone can not do something.  If you said ""I can't climb Everest"" you might be right, but anyone can not do a thing.

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

&gt;https://whyquit.com/pr/123106.html

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"3288",92,"write_as_rayne",16,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations. I think I am extremely salty, because the more I learn, the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late, and it is frustrating. And as an aside, I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers, as its implied. In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience with more than just a few coworkers or a child.

"3289",93,"SnakeAndTheApple",16,1,92,1,0,"&gt;  I am fed up

You need to let that one go. That isn't a greater reason to pay attention to your cause, and being upset isn't valuable, here. 

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D 

&gt;  I appreciate that you were able to better articulate that my issue was with the thought more people are going to lump the two generations together, and less to do with the actual use of the word or. Thank you for that, I plan to work to recognize my own misdirection!

"3290",94,"Kraz31",16,1,89,1,0,"And this is where context is important. The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free **Kids,** the investigation talks about tobacco companies targeting the ""next generation"" and ""America's youth,"" and the petition the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids submitted to the FTC specifically talks about protecting kids and young people (i.e. teens).

Again, non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising. Tobacco companies know this. So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? They aren't. They're targeting Gen-Z. The author clearly misused the label of millennial in his article, whether unintentionally (becuase he, likely many people, don't realize how old millennials are) or intentionally (because ""millennial"" drives clicks)."
"3291",95,"SnakeAndTheApple",16,1,94,1,0,"&gt; The author twice uses ""millennial"" as the description of the target audience but the investigation was led by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "
"3292",96,"Kraz31",16,1,95,2,0,"&gt; That is incorrect 

Check your facts man, I'll even give you a source: [https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data\_statistics/fact\_sheets/youth\_data/tobacco\_use/index.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/youth_data/tobacco_use/index.htm)

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

I'm a marketer, and specifically *rely* on people's positivity that they're immune.

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke.

"3365",169,"SnakeAndTheApple",16,1,168,1,1,"&gt;  I don't understand why anyone is surprised or upset that tobacco corporations are trying to sell their product.

seems pretty obvious to me, having been raised under a generation that had to see a lot of the harms of smoking first-hand through my grandparents, uncles, and aunts

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

&gt; A corporation gets it's orders from it's shareholders, and the shareholders always say the same thing: make us money. At any cost.

okay, but i think you might be speaking passionately, while trying to distract from the topic at hand"
"3366",170,"arconreef",16,1,169,1,0,"The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame. They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products. That's what corporations do. They could not do anything other than what they are doing. It's how they were designed to function.

It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make, but it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption. In my view that is a very misguided and futile venture on the same level as abstinence only sex ed. Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

"3367",171,"SnakeAndTheApple",16,1,170,1,0,"&gt; The implication is that tobacco corporations are promoting cigarettes indirectly through social media. I'm saying they are not to blame.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs. 

&gt; It is also my understanding that cigarette use is in decline, while e-cigarette use is on the rise.

I don't think that's in-context to anything I've said, so far. I'm also keeping the discussion in-context to the article.

&gt; I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make

The point I'm making is straight-forward, and I'm not using round-about language. I'm pretty direct in what I say. 

&gt; it looks like you're advocating the ""say no to drugs"" DARE method of reducing tobacco consumption

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking. 

I don't think you're the expert to be listening to, and your motives/ethics seem to be a bit suspect. "

Yes you can.  Anyone can not do something.  If you said ""I can't climb Everest"" you might be right, but anyone can not do a thing.

You make your two feet walk to the store, you make your arm reach into your wallet, you make your mouth say ""Pack of smokes"" to the clerk, you make your hands open them, you make your hands take one out, and you make your hands light one up.

Do anything but those things instead, scream, cry, smash things, go for a run, writhe on the floor, tear your hair out, eat a meal, anything but those combination of things, you'll succeed.

It's not easy but it's simple.

90% of all long term (10+ years) quitters quit cold turkey.  It's the best way because you learn to accept the cravings and you make a psychological decision that you will not accept your craving's input into your behavior any longer.

And cravings aren't that bad.  It's not being burned at the stake, it's not being broken on the wheel, it's not being crucified.  It's annoying and that's it.  

Learn strategies to ignore it, dig your heels in, and make a decision not to ""try to quit"" but that you are no longer a smoker and just accordingly no matter how you feel.  No matter how you feel just don't smoke.  And in a very short period of time it won't even be challenging.

Cravings peak on Days 1, 3 and 7 after quitting.  After then it's far easier than it is that first week.

Okay, I *too* have an academic background where the minutia of defined language is important (and is even detail-specific), and too place importance on the non-trivial use of language (being a strong advocate of information ethics). 

The author didn't fuck up with casual article for failing to apply Linnaeus' classification to our generations, and it's not actually a massive issue as of yet that we don't have a clear line with our next generation - it may even be to their benefit, with our not holding traditional prejudices between us. /:D

Not only *isn't* it imperative, our two groups are massively similar (as far as generations go). It was imperative to create a clear boundary between Generation X and Millennials, but even our two groups are meaningfully closer, culturally, than the generation gaps that existed before that.

&gt; as someone working in higher education

i'm going to ask you to reconsider saying that one out-loud in conversation from here-on-out

one, as a peer you need to consider that you might be in the awkward spot of speaking this way to your professional *peers*

two, by trying to take advantage of your position in the way you have, you're contributing to a pretty major cultural issue where the general public is feeling unsafe speaking to academics, who trivialize their perspectives, imply greater understanding (often coupling their arguments with intimations of there being need for respect and deference in light of the scholarly background), where the costs of that sort of casual attitude is the public balking at scientists in general. 

this is one of those things that usually gets included in soft-skills training. 

&gt; I'm tired of correcting them

Okay, well, *I'm* tired of scientists leaving our culture more anti-science, where I'm a scientist by training, and by education. By virtue of my (limited) association to the Scientific Leaders Program, I can also suggest that there's a leadership-level worry that individual academics/scientists have been causing real harm by awkwardly trying to force conversations forward, not actually having the social training to express their ideas well to the public. 

Most institutions are having whole new departments being created (or having old ones repurposed) for catching-and-preventing their employees from saying something silly, or potentially inflammatory.

But where you might feel differently about the need to have this discussion in general (and where I know you're trying to force that discussion forward through my reply), I really think that your objection was managed by the author correctly differentiating the groups with the word 'or'. "
"3501",92,"write_as_rayne",17,1,91,1,0,"You are completely correct in that my issue was with the possibility of interpretation that 'millennials' or Gen-Z was a colloquial way to combine the two together. I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two, and constantly having to interject into meetings that the only millennials we are really seeing are our Adult Learners. The ship has sailed for many colleges to prepare for millennials, but the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust. I've attended national, regional, and local conferences mirroring similar themes and presentations.

&gt; I am fed up with Administrators not differentiating the two

his point, it's just differentiating post-grad and grad students from the undergrads. Plus, there could be major cultural benefits to there *not* being clear lines between the generations - and more empathy. 

&gt; I think I am extremely salty

I appreciate that you're catching that. Being salty isn't a positive.

&gt; the rhetoric is still so heavy in the local college consortium that last year's intercollegiate symposium was on ""Meeting the Needs of the Millennials"", and was fought with presentations discussing the next few years and the plans to change things so their millennials students will better adjust

...I'm sorry, but that's not a problem. I'm not understanding how it's supposed to be problematic in-context. We *do* need to identify and adapt for Millennial issues - I can remember the (female) Provost for my school specifically addressing that there needed to be a generational overhaul towards how young men in academics are treated, and even that the changes needed to come at the expense of the benefits that have been gained by women over time. 

We *do* need to have symposia to that effect. I don't agree with it's identifying a concern. And I'm not seeing the data as to suggest there's a meaningfully different culture separating the 'two groups'. Zees and Millennials seem to behave and think very similarly. 

&gt; the more I identify ways Generation Z students are not the focus point, at least not yet in grand scale, and I fear by the time all colleges are there, it will be too late

Okay. I think the null hypothesis would be ""treating Millennials and Generation Z similarly isn't a problem, provided we're just adapting for our present environment, and not trying to create generationally-specific campuses"". 

Everything from the way we learn to the way we communicate changed, between Generation x and the Millennials. We haven't had nearly the same cultural gulfs established between Zees and Millennials. I think it's possible that we don't need to address things as you're suggesting, and that you're making the mistake of presuming that the Millennial generation is meaningfully different from Z. I think there's identifiable means of addressing which is true, and I think there's room to prove the null hypothesis. 

&gt; I obviously do not use the phrase ""as someone who works in higher education"" with my peers

You just have, casually, presuming you were speaking to a layman - and again, it's actually a *greater* issue if you're addressing a layman, because they're the ones we're trying to convince. We need to be nice to the people who want to have our backs, but don't understand the information we're presenting.  

&gt;  In this instance, it was meant to convey the scope of my experience 

I get that, and I'll even go so far as to impress that I'm not just arbitrarily prodding at you. I'm also not implying you're anti-social, or badly socialized - but right now, when scientists speak, we need to be ethically backing each other up, whenever possible, and never undercutting one-another *except* for where evidence is being disrespected, or ignored. Whether we're fed up, or not. 

I'm qualifying that statement with a 'whenever possible', out of respect towards the best part of science specifically *coming from* being critical of one-another's work - but compromise needs to be made where we speak, because we need to be good marketers for one-another's ideas and values, in front of the laymen. 

&gt;  I have no problems speaking in similar ways with professional peers, or even my supervisor, nor do I have a problem with correcting them, if they are wrong

Cool. And you're smart enough to do that privately, where the social side of human interaction doesn't land badly on you publicly, right? ;D

I'll go ahead and just shoot that one in the head. Groups that advocate for 'Kids' try to cause cultural change in people who *aren't* kids, as to create a more kid-friendly environment. 

I can appreciate that people can play up the ambiguity of language, the context is just 'young people who're exposed to online marketing', and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths. 

It's interesting to think that's going to be transitioning, soon,  though. /:D

&gt; non-smoking millennials aren't likely to start smoking, regardless of advertising

That is incorrect, and contrary to our general understanding to advertising in general - and people's exposure to tobacco marketing can be life-long, if you have smokers in the family. 

&gt; Tobacco companies know this. 

They do *not* know that, and know the opposite to be true. 

&gt; So why would social media campaigns be targeted at millennials? 

As the start of an incremental campaign to cause long-term cultural change that's sympathetic towards smoking. 

That's not even getting into *clever* uses of marketing, that's just taking a standard application of marketing over time. 

&gt; They're targeting Gen-Z.

They're doing that *also*. I don't think you know what you're talking about, and that you're not actually addressing the way-things-are, so to speak. I think you're speaking from your gut, a lot. "

Here's the key stat if don't feel like clicking a link:

&gt; Nearly 9 out of 10 cigarette smokers first try cigarette smoking by age 18, and 98% first try smoking by age 26. 

But you're going to argue that tobacco is targeting people in their late 20s to late 30s?

Here's another great point on the CDC website:

&gt;**Factors associated with youth tobacco product use include the following:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Social and physical environments  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""The way mass media show tobacco product use as a normal activity can make young people want to try these products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  ""Youth are more likely to use tobacco products if they see people their age using these products.

That correlates directly to the investigation by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In fact, the investigation uses the following statement:

&gt;**Target: Young, popular influencers**  
&gt;  
&gt;Influcencers are recruited based on their youthful appearance and number of followers.

Finally, from your last comment:

&gt;and that'd include pre-and-post millennial youths 

What the hell is a pre-millennial youth? That phrase is an oxymoron. All pre-millennials are 40 years old.

[Under 20 has been their target demo for decades.](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0008.pdf) Why? Because they're the most susceptible population and once they start quitting is extremely difficult ([less than 10% of people trying to quit does so successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6044a2.htm?s_cid=mm6044a2_w)).

I'm a marketer, and specifically *rely* on people's positivity that they're immune. Sometimes I even plant ideas into advertisements that *overtly tell you* that I'm marketing to you, to distract you from the way you *think* I'm marketing to you (like adding a brand's logo into all reflective surfaces, while you're busy reading my wacky ""this is ironic advertising"" text, or hiring someone to talk affirmatively to people in the comment section on Reddit, when people are turning one of my ads into an ironic meme).

Plus, I know it works. It would have been *really* easy for me to have picked up smoking over the years, but I'd had friends (often smokers) step up repeatedly to adulate my non-smoking, and still take the time to keep me as part of our community in light of my non-smoking. 

I really don't respect the whole 'it's a person's choice' dismissal. Yes, it's their choice, and it's very likely they'd choose to not smoke if they knew their friends thought it was a positive to not smoke.

seems pretty obvious to me, having been raised under a generation that had to see a lot of the harms of smoking first-hand through my grandparents, uncles, and aunts

that shit was expensive, painful, involved a lot of gross hacking and wheezing, phlegm everywhere, cancerous bullshit, and on, and on, and on

plus, every family stepped up to help those people, because that's what family *does*

i can understand why people are pissed about this, and it doesn't take a half-second's worth of thought to get to the point. this is a massive social issue, and a functional medical issue, and people are trying to adapt capitalist morality to accomodate the subject, where we actually had people reducing their usage (for sake of great reasons, *and* strong education, *and* there being a strong anti-smoking culture). 

&gt; If you don't like that then you should advocate for changing the corporate structure.

no, they should stay focused, and retain their anti-smoking attitudes, not getting distracted by having empathy with corporate structuring. where it'd be cool if there were more ethics in corporate values when it comes to self-harming products, that'd probably distract people from their actual concerns, which are *actually* the rise of people smoking, and the coordinated efforts to make that happen.

If there's pro-smoking marketing (as is being addressed in-context to the article), they are. Explicitly, by intention and design. 

&gt; They were deprived of the ability to advertise to the public, so they have found alternate methods to promote their products.

They were deprived of access to print, TV, and other traditional means of advertising because there was strong study to the effect of the significance of smoking-related advertising, and there's since been study as to how the applied solution to the high-cost problem has worked - and it had worked well, reducing tobacco consumption overall. 

If that's known, and people decided to say ""fuck the triple-bottom-line, we're going to sell to kids on Twitter"", then they're absolutely to blame, and there's a lack of meaningful ethics being applied. It's hard to even couch this one under 'capitalist morality' - the long-term harms of smoking are *expensive*, both privately and publicly. 

And a big part of getting people to not smoke was a means of offsetting the public costs of smoking - by solving the cigarette problem, our budgets (and taxes) don't have to reflect those costs.

I... what? No, that's not what I'd said, at all, and it's not in-context to what I'd said. I'll go so far as to say it'd be nutty to put that out there. 

I don't know what you're talking about, what I've said had nothing to do with zero-use-of-drugs, or associating mainstream drugs with tobacco. I very legitimately have no idea where you were going with this one. 

&gt; Teens are going to have sex. Teens are going to do drugs. It's what they do. Next thing you'll be telling them to stop breathing.

I don't have to - you'll feed them smokes. /s

Bud, the kids manage to get into all sorts of fun on their own, without causing the long-term harm cigarettes/tobacco does to a person's body. And I'm saying that as a life-long non-smoker who hasn't had the same policy towards abstinence. 

I have no idea where you were going with that, and it'd be an act of good faith to suggest that it was a mistake on your part having referenced *DARE* at all. 

&gt; Efforts are better spent working to change the corporations that produce the drugs and the laws and regulations that control their sale.

...No, this isn't new ground, we can literally just apply regulation on the advertising of tobacco and cigarettes online, and then apply the same cultural solution that existed last time - while imperfect, and while there were advertisers who were willing to face fines/act unethically, the *proof* is in the cultural successes of the generations before social media, and the overall reduction of smoking.

yeah i don't want to deal with family members i love dying long, slow, painful deaths because they picked up a habit at some point, and i don't know that smoking would only kill off people who make the earth worse

&gt;  and we already have more than enough education on the risk/negative impacts of it

clearly we don't, we're in a different environment than that, and smoking is on the rise, it's likely that we need to change our education and knowledge to reflect that there are new and different ways to encourage people to smoke

&gt; there's only so much you can help someone

it's possible that people *haven't* been helping one-another, and that we've let the conversation lapse in ways that have been harmful

&gt;  and an outright Ban on all cigs aint gonna happen to be honest

we also didn't apply that solution the last time we managed to reduce smoking, and i'm thinking that means you're not saying anything that's useful, there - no one is saying total ban, and it's kind of nutty to bring fears of a total ban up"
