Abstract

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

Dude(ette?), I would argue that the constant state of feeling insecure about something as fundamental as your sexuality is traumatic.

Sorry, that musta been hard...

On another note, your memory mirrors mine in some ways. I'm widely known as brilliant, genius, prodigy, etc. As a software engineer, I can easily think in 10, 12 dimensions for data structures.

I'm 26 and still haven't been on a date. Everyone says I'm a great guy, but I'm shit scared to go out there. I don't know any other gay person. It was hard, really hard, but life hasn't gotten easier :)

I've always been frustrated by the lack of memory of just basic things. Its as if I can't remember things if they just feel random, like the name of a street or someone's name.

It makes small talk incredibly painful to go through, and Im sure many people get the feeling that I simply don't care since I cant say what my favorite ___ is, cant recall basic info to share with them, or just take longer than usual to recall something. 

However, if its visual, and about how something ""works"" in a logical sense, then I am able to remember it far better. Hence, in classes I can often stuggle in tests to remember everything or do writing assignments, but as soon as someone asks me how something ""works"" then I can go incredibly in-depth.

But then I also saw my father get brain damage and he has lost his memory functions as well (like the guy in the movie Memento, except he doesn't have the drive to motivate himself, he just sits around). 

And from those experiences I got my biggest fear which is memory loss. Even early on, I read on the internet that depression is one of the causes of memory loss. Reading this made me very depressed.

What a stupid vicious circle, I thought. Now I can only live each day trying to hold onto my mental faculties for as long as possible, while every day my fears are growing that they might soon slip away.

Abstract

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

Abstract

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

"205",5,"kepler456",10,2,4,7,0,"Nope, my depression was because I grew up in a society where it was not acceptable to be gay. There was no trauma, just me worried about coming out and how I would do it. Would I be accepted and stuff like that. It's all done now and all is good. I am not depressed anymore. But, it was never a conscious thing to forget anything. There were no bad memories, just possibilities of bad outcomes. There was nothing that I wanted to forget either consciously or sub-consciously. 

Even today, if I think of a favourite song, I can't name one. I listen to it and I'm like, yes that's the one, it's one of my favourites. 

I definitely agree that the conscious choice has a role to play, but it was not the reason in my case. I can't really socialise point blank because I have no conversation in this sense. Music, sports, movies, that's what people talk about. I saw a really great movie last week, I don't know the name, I know what happened. But then again, I saw all the Harry Potter movies three years ago and I rewatched them a month ago and some of them seemed brand new to me :) I value having these memories because I would be more social with them. But I don't have them.

I do have a high IQ, passed the Mensa test and also have a high empathy score. Logic and learning comes easy, but nothing that needs to stay without logic, if that makes sense? "

"207",45,"kepler456",10,7,44,1,0,"Dude here :) Yeah it was. After coming out a few people didn't believe it because I do not fit any of the stereotypes they know about. Well, they learnt something at least lol. I held it in till I was 24. Broke down crying (held up till I left the group) one day when walking home after some friends (we were a new group of friends all in a new country) and I spoke about kids and when they asked me if I have a girlfriend (nothing new, but that day was the last straw). The next day I came out to one in that group. 

I'm 26 and still haven't been on a date. Everyone says I'm a great guy, but I'm shit scared to go out there. I don't know any other gay person. It was hard, really hard, but life hasn't gotten easier :) 

I'm only putting this out there because there are those who read this that would feel more confident about themselves and others who could be more accepting of someone who comes out to them. "
"208",55,"Arytek",10,9,5,2,0,"Weird, what you've described fits me to a tee. 

I've always been frustrated by the lack of memory of just basic things. Its as if I can't remember things if they just feel random, like the name of a street or someone's name. It tells me nothing about that street, or about that person, so maybe my mind discards it as information that's not useful. No matter how much I may actually value the thing, this still happens. 

It makes small talk incredibly painful to go through, and Im sure many people get the feeling that I simply don't care since I cant say what my favorite ___ is, cant recall basic info to share with them, or just take longer than usual to recall something. 

However, if its visual, and about how something ""works"" in a logical sense, then I am able to remember it far better. Hence, in classes I can often stuggle in tests to remember everything or do writing assignments, but as soon as someone asks me how something ""works"" then I can go incredibly in-depth. I'll remember very complex info about every topic, but completely lose all of the names/titles.

I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

(I also have high IQ and passed the Mensa test). As a sidenote, I think my IQ is linked to my depression (I read a few things about the effects a high IQ can be isolating in a way, and I feel like having high empathy only makes that harder). "
"209",56,"kepler456",10,9,55,1,0,"Wow. This resonates with me too:

&gt;I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

Also, some times I think far faster than I can speak and I speak fast, so things get lost in translation. I am sure this is something I can train on, but it does get hard explaining stuff some times. 

The high IQ depression is usually because you cannot find like minded people to converse with. Thankfully I have some of those. Maybe empathy makes it worse, but I cannot imagine not having it :) I am glad I have it. The downside is that I feel sad not just for me alone. "
"210",6,"everflow",10,2,4,3,0,"I want to know if the opposite could be true as well. When I was only a child growing up, I already witnessed my grandmothers getting alzheimer's and losing their memories, and even my mother complained she couldn't concentrate on studying anymore, even though she was only in her forties, but she was greatly exaggerating actually; she is still doing fine today.

But then I also saw my father get brain damage and he has lost his memory functions as well (like the guy in the movie Memento, except he doesn't have the drive to motivate himself, he just sits around). 

And from those experiences I got my biggest fear which is memory loss. Even early on, I read on the internet that depression is one of the causes of memory loss. Reading this made me very depressed.

What a stupid vicious circle, I thought. Now I can only live each day trying to hold onto my mental faculties for as long as possible, while every day my fears are growing that they might soon slip away.

Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

Well, they learnt something at least lol. I held it in till I was 24.

The next day I came out to one in that group. 

I'm 26 and still haven't been on a date. Everyone says I'm a great guy, but I'm shit scared to go out there. I don't know any other gay person. It was hard, really hard, but life hasn't gotten easier :)

"273",55,"Arytek",12,9,5,2,0,"Weird, what you've described fits me to a tee. 

I've always been frustrated by the lack of memory of just basic things. Its as if I can't remember things if they just feel random, like the name of a street or someone's name. It tells me nothing about that street, or about that person, so maybe my mind discards it as information that's not useful. No matter how much I may actually value the thing, this still happens. 

It makes small talk incredibly painful to go through, and Im sure many people get the feeling that I simply don't care since I cant say what my favorite ___ is, cant recall basic info to share with them, or just take longer than usual to recall something. 

However, if its visual, and about how something ""works"" in a logical sense, then I am able to remember it far better. Hence, in classes I can often stuggle in tests to remember everything or do writing assignments, but as soon as someone asks me how something ""works"" then I can go incredibly in-depth. I'll remember very complex info about every topic, but completely lose all of the names/titles.

I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

&gt; New molecules reverse memory loss linked to depression, aging


&gt; In another experiment involving preclinical models of aging, memory declines were rapidly reversed and performance increased to 80 per cent after administration, essentially reaching levels seen in youth or earlier stages of adulthood. This improvement lasted over two months with daily treatment.

Abstract

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory.

Abstract

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

"344",5,"kepler456",14,2,4,9,0,"Nope, my depression was because I grew up in a society where it was not acceptable to be gay. There was no trauma, just me worried about coming out and how I would do it. Would I be accepted and stuff like that. It's all done now and all is good. I am not depressed anymore. But, it was never a conscious thing to forget anything. There were no bad memories, just possibilities of bad outcomes. There was nothing that I wanted to forget either consciously or sub-consciously. 

Even today, if I think of a favourite song, I can't name one. I listen to it and I'm like, yes that's the one, it's one of my favourites. 

I definitely agree that the conscious choice has a role to play, but it was not the reason in my case. I can't really socialise point blank because I have no conversation in this sense. Music, sports, movies, that's what people talk about. I saw a really great movie last week, I don't know the name, I know what happened.

The next day I came out to one in that group. 

I'm 26 and still haven't been on a date. Everyone says I'm a great guy, but I'm shit scared to go out there. I don't know any other gay person. It was hard, really hard, but life hasn't gotten easier :)

"347",55,"Arytek",14,9,5,2,0,"Weird, what you've described fits me to a tee. 

I've always been frustrated by the lack of memory of just basic things. Its as if I can't remember things if they just feel random, like the name of a street or someone's name. It tells me nothing about that street, or about that person, so maybe my mind discards it as information that's not useful. No matter how much I may actually value the thing, this still happens. 

It makes small talk incredibly painful to go through, and Im sure many people get the feeling that I simply don't care since I cant say what my favorite ___ is, cant recall basic info to share with them, or just take longer than usual to recall something. 

However, if its visual, and about how something ""works"" in a logical sense, then I am able to remember it far better. Hence, in classes I can often stuggle in tests to remember everything or do writing assignments, but as soon as someone asks me how something ""works"" then I can go incredibly in-depth. I'll remember very complex info about every topic, but completely lose all of the names/titles.

I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

The high IQ depression is usually because you cannot find like minded people to converse with. Thankfully I have some of those. Maybe empathy makes it worse, but I cannot imagine not having it :) I am glad I have it. The downside is that I feel sad not just for me alone. "

But then I also saw my father get brain damage and he has lost his memory functions as well (like the guy in the movie Memento, except he doesn't have the drive to motivate himself, he just sits around). 

And from those experiences I got my biggest fear which is memory loss. Even early on, I read on the internet that depression is one of the causes of memory loss. Reading this made me very depressed.

&gt; New molecules reverse memory loss linked to depression, aging


&gt; In another experiment involving preclinical models of aging, memory declines were rapidly reversed and performance increased to 80 per cent after administration, essentially reaching levels seen in youth or earlier stages of adulthood. This improvement lasted over two months with daily treatment.

Abstract

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

"421",5,"kepler456",16,2,4,9,0,"Nope, my depression was because I grew up in a society where it was not acceptable to be gay. There was no trauma, just me worried about coming out and how I would do it. Would I be accepted and stuff like that. It's all done now and all is good. I am not depressed anymore. But, it was never a conscious thing to forget anything. There were no bad memories, just possibilities of bad outcomes. There was nothing that I wanted to forget either consciously or sub-consciously. 

Even today, if I think of a favourite song, I can't name one. I listen to it and I'm like, yes that's the one, it's one of my favourites. 

I definitely agree that the conscious choice has a role to play, but it was not the reason in my case. I can't really socialise point blank because I have no conversation in this sense. Music, sports, movies, that's what people talk about. I saw a really great movie last week, I don't know the name, I know what happened. But then again, I saw all the Harry Potter movies three years ago and I rewatched them a month ago and some of them seemed brand new to me :) I value having these memories because I would be more social with them. But I don't have them.

I do have a high IQ, passed the Mensa test and also have a high empathy score. Logic and learning comes easy, but nothing that needs to stay without logic, if that makes sense? "

On another note, your memory mirrors mine in some ways. I'm widely known as brilliant, genius, prodigy, etc. As a software engineer, I can easily think in 10, 12 dimensions for data structures.  But I can't remember movie, song, or actor names to save my life. I don't remember street names, ever, but think spatially and virtually never get lost. "
"423",45,"kepler456",16,7,44,2,0,"Dude here :) Yeah it was. After coming out a few people didn't believe it because I do not fit any of the stereotypes they know about. Well, they learnt something at least lol. I held it in till I was 24. Broke down crying (held up till I left the group) one day when walking home after some friends (we were a new group of friends all in a new country) and I spoke about kids and when they asked me if I have a girlfriend (nothing new, but that day was the last straw). The next day I came out to one in that group. 

I'm 26 and still haven't been on a date. Everyone says I'm a great guy, but I'm shit scared to go out there. I don't know any other gay person. It was hard, really hard, but life hasn't gotten easier :) 

I'm only putting this out there because there are those who read this that would feel more confident about themselves and others who could be more accepting of someone who comes out to them. "
"424",55,"Arytek",16,9,5,2,0,"Weird, what you've described fits me to a tee. 

I've always been frustrated by the lack of memory of just basic things. Its as if I can't remember things if they just feel random, like the name of a street or someone's name. It tells me nothing about that street, or about that person, so maybe my mind discards it as information that's not useful. No matter how much I may actually value the thing, this still happens. 

It makes small talk incredibly painful to go through, and Im sure many people get the feeling that I simply don't care since I cant say what my favorite ___ is, cant recall basic info to share with them, or just take longer than usual to recall something. 

However, if its visual, and about how something ""works"" in a logical sense, then I am able to remember it far better. Hence, in classes I can often stuggle in tests to remember everything or do writing assignments, but as soon as someone asks me how something ""works"" then I can go incredibly in-depth. I'll remember very complex info about every topic, but completely lose all of the names/titles.

I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

(I also have high IQ and passed the Mensa test). As a sidenote, I think my IQ is linked to my depression (I read a few things about the effects a high IQ can be isolating in a way, and I feel like having high empathy only makes that harder). "
"425",56,"kepler456",16,9,55,1,0,"Wow. This resonates with me too:

&gt;I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

Also, some times I think far faster than I can speak and I speak fast, so things get lost in translation. I am sure this is something I can train on, but it does get hard explaining stuff some times. 

The high IQ depression is usually because you cannot find like minded people to converse with. Thankfully I have some of those. Maybe empathy makes it worse, but I cannot imagine not having it :) I am glad I have it. The downside is that I feel sad not just for me alone. "
"426",6,"everflow",16,2,4,3,0,"I want to know if the opposite could be true as well. When I was only a child growing up, I already witnessed my grandmothers getting alzheimer's and losing their memories, and even my mother complained she couldn't concentrate on studying anymore, even though she was only in her forties, but she was greatly exaggerating actually; she is still doing fine today.

But then I also saw my father get brain damage and he has lost his memory functions as well (like the guy in the movie Memento, except he doesn't have the drive to motivate himself, he just sits around). 

And from those experiences I got my biggest fear which is memory loss. Even early on, I read on the internet that depression is one of the causes of memory loss. Reading this made me very depressed.

What a stupid vicious circle, I thought. Now I can only live each day trying to hold onto my mental faculties for as long as possible, while every day my fears are growing that they might soon slip away.

And from those experiences I got my biggest fear which is memory loss. Even early on, I read on the internet that depression is one of the causes of memory loss. Reading this made me very depressed.

What a stupid vicious circle, I thought. Now I can only live each day trying to hold onto my mental faculties for as long as possible, while every day my fears are growing that they might soon slip away.

I don't know if I will ever find out if my constant worrying will lead to my improvement or deterioration, before it'll be too late."

&gt; New molecules reverse memory loss linked to depression, aging


&gt; In another experiment involving preclinical models of aging, memory declines were rapidly reversed and performance increased to 80 per cent after administration, essentially reaching levels seen in youth or earlier stages of adulthood. This improvement lasted over two months with daily treatment.

Abstract

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

"499",4,"Ouroboros612",18,2,3,23,0,"The interesting thing to me is if a conscious choice of deeming memories non-important has any impact on your memories.

Someone not depressed might cherish and want their memories. Someone who is depressed don't care or even want to forget.   
  
Basically, maybe how important a person values their memories has an actual impact on retaining them."
"500",5,"kepler456",18,2,4,10,0,"Nope, my depression was because I grew up in a society where it was not acceptable to be gay. There was no trauma, just me worried about coming out and how I would do it. Would I be accepted and stuff like that. It's all done now and all is good. I am not depressed anymore. But, it was never a conscious thing to forget anything. There were no bad memories, just possibilities of bad outcomes. There was nothing that I wanted to forget either consciously or sub-consciously. 

Even today, if I think of a favourite song, I can't name one. I listen to it and I'm like, yes that's the one, it's one of my favourites. 

I definitely agree that the conscious choice has a role to play, but it was not the reason in my case. I can't really socialise point blank because I have no conversation in this sense. Music, sports, movies, that's what people talk about. I saw a really great movie last week, I don't know the name, I know what happened. But then again, I saw all the Harry Potter movies three years ago and I rewatched them a month ago and some of them seemed brand new to me :) I value having these memories because I would be more social with them. But I don't have them.

I do have a high IQ, passed the Mensa test and also have a high empathy score. Logic and learning comes easy, but nothing that needs to stay without logic, if that makes sense? "
"501",44,"MyWholeSelf",18,7,5,2,0,"&gt; There was no trauma, just me worried about coming out and how I would do it.

Dude(ette?), I would argue that the constant state of feeling insecure about something as fundamental as your sexuality is traumatic.

Sorry, that musta been hard...

On another note, your memory mirrors mine in some ways. I'm widely known as brilliant, genius, prodigy, etc. As a software engineer, I can easily think in 10, 12 dimensions for data structures.  But I can't remember movie, song, or actor names to save my life. I don't remember street names, ever, but think spatially and virtually never get lost. "
"502",45,"kepler456",18,7,44,2,0,"Dude here :) Yeah it was. After coming out a few people didn't believe it because I do not fit any of the stereotypes they know about. Well, they learnt something at least lol. I held it in till I was 24. Broke down crying (held up till I left the group) one day when walking home after some friends (we were a new group of friends all in a new country) and I spoke about kids and when they asked me if I have a girlfriend (nothing new, but that day was the last straw). The next day I came out to one in that group. 

I'm 26 and still haven't been on a date. Everyone says I'm a great guy, but I'm shit scared to go out there. I don't know any other gay person. It was hard, really hard, but life hasn't gotten easier :) 

I'm only putting this out there because there are those who read this that would feel more confident about themselves and others who could be more accepting of someone who comes out to them. "
"503",71,"MyWholeSelf",18,17,45,1,0,"Damn, and only out 2 years... 

Good luck, I hope you can brave up, go on dates, and accept the truth that anybody having any kind of problem with your sexuality is the one with any kind of problem. "
"504",55,"Arytek",18,9,5,2,0,"Weird, what you've described fits me to a tee. 

I've always been frustrated by the lack of memory of just basic things. Its as if I can't remember things if they just feel random, like the name of a street or someone's name. It tells me nothing about that street, or about that person, so maybe my mind discards it as information that's not useful. No matter how much I may actually value the thing, this still happens. 

It makes small talk incredibly painful to go through, and Im sure many people get the feeling that I simply don't care since I cant say what my favorite ___ is, cant recall basic info to share with them, or just take longer than usual to recall something. 

However, if its visual, and about how something ""works"" in a logical sense, then I am able to remember it far better. Hence, in classes I can often stuggle in tests to remember everything or do writing assignments, but as soon as someone asks me how something ""works"" then I can go incredibly in-depth. I'll remember very complex info about every topic, but completely lose all of the names/titles.

I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

(I also have high IQ and passed the Mensa test). As a sidenote, I think my IQ is linked to my depression (I read a few things about the effects a high IQ can be isolating in a way, and I feel like having high empathy only makes that harder). "
"505",56,"kepler456",18,9,55,1,0,"Wow. This resonates with me too:

&gt;I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

Also, some times I think far faster than I can speak and I speak fast, so things get lost in translation. I am sure this is something I can train on, but it does get hard explaining stuff some times. 

The high IQ depression is usually because you cannot find like minded people to converse with. Thankfully I have some of those. Maybe empathy makes it worse, but I cannot imagine not having it :) I am glad I have it. The downside is that I feel sad not just for me alone. "

It makes small talk incredibly painful to go through, and Im sure many people get the feeling that I simply don't care since I cant say what my favorite ___ is, cant recall basic info to share with them, or just take longer than usual to recall something. 

However, if its visual, and about how something ""works"" in a logical sense, then I am able to remember it far better. Hence, in classes I can often stuggle in tests to remember everything or do writing assignments, but as soon as someone asks me how something ""works"" then I can go incredibly in-depth. I'll remember very complex info about every topic, but completely lose all of the names/titles.

I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

(I also have high IQ and passed the Mensa test). As a sidenote, I think my IQ is linked to my depression (I read a few things about the effects a high IQ can be isolating in a way, and I feel like having high empathy only makes that harder). "

&gt;I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

Also, some times I think far faster than I can speak and I speak fast, so things get lost in translation. I am sure this is something I can train on, but it does get hard explaining stuff some times. 

The high IQ depression is usually because you cannot find like minded people to converse with. Thankfully I have some of those. Maybe empathy makes it worse, but I cannot imagine not having it :) I am glad I have it. The downside is that I feel sad not just for me alone. "

Dude(ette?), I would argue that the constant state of feeling insecure about something as fundamental as your sexuality is traumatic.

On another note, your memory mirrors mine in some ways. I'm widely known as brilliant, genius, prodigy, etc. As a software engineer, I can easily think in 10, 12 dimensions for data structures.

The next day I came out to one in that group. 

I'm 26 and still haven't been on a date. Everyone says I'm a great guy, but I'm shit scared to go out there. I don't know any other gay person. It was hard, really hard, but life hasn't gotten easier :)

"546",6,"everflow",19,2,4,4,0,"I want to know if the opposite could be true as well. When I was only a child growing up, I already witnessed my grandmothers getting alzheimer's and losing their memories, and even my mother complained she couldn't concentrate on studying anymore, even though she was only in her forties, but she was greatly exaggerating actually; she is still doing fine today.

But then I also saw my father get brain damage and he has lost his memory functions as well (like the guy in the movie Memento, except he doesn't have the drive to motivate himself, he just sits around). 

And from those experiences I got my biggest fear which is memory loss. Even early on, I read on the internet that depression is one of the causes of memory loss. Reading this made me very depressed.

What a stupid vicious circle, I thought. Now I can only live each day trying to hold onto my mental faculties for as long as possible, while every day my fears are growing that they might soon slip away.

&gt; New molecules reverse memory loss linked to depression, aging


&gt; In another experiment involving preclinical models of aging, memory declines were rapidly reversed and performance increased to 80 per cent after administration, essentially reaching levels seen in youth or earlier stages of adulthood. This improvement lasted over two months with daily treatment.

Novel Benzodiazepine-Like Ligands with Various Anxiolytic, Antidepressant, or Pro-Cognitive Profiles.

Abstract

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

"578",3,"kepler456",20,1,1,28,0,"Does Depression lead to memory loss? This could explain a lot about why I can't remember certain things: names in particular, lyrics, etc. since my early teens.  "
"579",4,"Ouroboros612",20,2,3,22,0,"The interesting thing to me is if a conscious choice of deeming memories non-important has any impact on your memories. Depressed people tend to want to forget or are apathetic to memories. Maybe neurologically, considering memories pointless has an actual impact on retaining them. Someone not depressed might cherish and want their memories. Someone who is depressed don't care or even want to forget.   
  
Basically, maybe how important a person values their memories has an actual impact on retaining them."
"580",5,"kepler456",20,2,4,10,0,"Nope, my depression was because I grew up in a society where it was not acceptable to be gay. There was no trauma, just me worried about coming out and how I would do it. Would I be accepted and stuff like that. It's all done now and all is good. I am not depressed anymore. But, it was never a conscious thing to forget anything. There were no bad memories, just possibilities of bad outcomes. There was nothing that I wanted to forget either consciously or sub-consciously. 

Even today, if I think of a favourite song, I can't name one. I listen to it and I'm like, yes that's the one, it's one of my favourites. 

I definitely agree that the conscious choice has a role to play, but it was not the reason in my case. I can't really socialise point blank because I have no conversation in this sense. Music, sports, movies, that's what people talk about. I saw a really great movie last week, I don't know the name, I know what happened. But then again, I saw all the Harry Potter movies three years ago and I rewatched them a month ago and some of them seemed brand new to me :) I value having these memories because I would be more social with them. But I don't have them.

I do have a high IQ, passed the Mensa test and also have a high empathy score. Logic and learning comes easy, but nothing that needs to stay without logic, if that makes sense? "

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

"619",4,"Ouroboros612",21,2,3,24,0,"The interesting thing to me is if a conscious choice of deeming memories non-important has any impact on your memories. Depressed people tend to want to forget or are apathetic to memories. Maybe neurologically, considering memories pointless has an actual impact on retaining them.

Basically, maybe how important a person values their memories has an actual impact on retaining them."
"620",5,"kepler456",21,2,4,10,0,"Nope, my depression was because I grew up in a society where it was not acceptable to be gay. There was no trauma, just me worried about coming out and how I would do it. Would I be accepted and stuff like that. It's all done now and all is good. I am not depressed anymore. But, it was never a conscious thing to forget anything. There were no bad memories, just possibilities of bad outcomes. There was nothing that I wanted to forget either consciously or sub-consciously. 

Even today, if I think of a favourite song, I can't name one. I listen to it and I'm like, yes that's the one, it's one of my favourites. 

I definitely agree that the conscious choice has a role to play, but it was not the reason in my case. I can't really socialise point blank because I have no conversation in this sense. Music, sports, movies, that's what people talk about. I saw a really great movie last week, I don't know the name, I know what happened. But then again, I saw all the Harry Potter movies three years ago and I rewatched them a month ago and some of them seemed brand new to me :) I value having these memories because I would be more social with them. But I don't have them.

I do have a high IQ, passed the Mensa test and also have a high empathy score. Logic and learning comes easy, but nothing that needs to stay without logic, if that makes sense? "
"621",44,"Arytek",21,7,5,3,0,"Weird, what you've described fits me to a tee. 

I've always been frustrated by the lack of memory of just basic things. Its as if I can't remember things if they just feel random, like the name of a street or someone's name. It tells me nothing about that street, or about that person, so maybe my mind discards it as information that's not useful. No matter how much I may actually value the thing, this still happens. 

It makes small talk incredibly painful to go through, and Im sure many people get the feeling that I simply don't care since I cant say what my favorite ___ is, cant recall basic info to share with them, or just take longer than usual to recall something. 

However, if its visual, and about how something ""works"" in a logical sense, then I am able to remember it far better. Hence, in classes I can often stuggle in tests to remember everything or do writing assignments, but as soon as someone asks me how something ""works"" then I can go incredibly in-depth. I'll remember very complex info about every topic, but completely lose all of the names/titles.

I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

(I also have high IQ and passed the Mensa test). As a sidenote, I think my IQ is linked to my depression (I read a few things about the effects a high IQ can be isolating in a way, and I feel like having high empathy only makes that harder). "
"622",45,"kepler456",21,7,44,2,0,"Wow. This resonates with me too:

&gt;I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

Also, some times I think far faster than I can speak and I speak fast, so things get lost in translation. I am sure this is something I can train on, but it does get hard explaining stuff some times. 

The high IQ depression is usually because you cannot find like minded people to converse with. Thankfully I have some of those. Maybe empathy makes it worse, but I cannot imagine not having it :) I am glad I have it. The downside is that I feel sad not just for me alone. "
"623",55,"MyWholeSelf",21,9,5,2,0,"&gt; There was no trauma, just me worried about coming out and how I would do it.

Dude(ette?), I would argue that the constant state of feeling insecure about something as fundamental as your sexuality is traumatic.

Sorry, that musta been hard...

On another note, your memory mirrors mine in some ways. I'm widely known as brilliant, genius, prodigy, etc. As a software engineer, I can easily think in 10, 12 dimensions for data structures.  But I can't remember movie, song, or actor names to save my life. I don't remember street names, ever, but think spatially and virtually never get lost. "
"624",56,"kepler456",21,9,55,2,0,"Dude here :) Yeah it was. After coming out a few people didn't believe it because I do not fit any of the stereotypes they know about. Well, they learnt something at least lol. I held it in till I was 24. Broke down crying (held up till I left the group) one day when walking home after some friends (we were a new group of friends all in a new country) and I spoke about kids and when they asked me if I have a girlfriend (nothing new, but that day was the last straw). The next day I came out to one in that group. 

I'm 26 and still haven't been on a date. Everyone says I'm a great guy, but I'm shit scared to go out there. I don't know any other gay person. It was hard, really hard, but life hasn't gotten easier :) 

I'm only putting this out there because there are those who read this that would feel more confident about themselves and others who could be more accepting of someone who comes out to them. "
"625",72,"MyWholeSelf",21,19,56,1,0,"Damn, and only out 2 years... 

Good luck, I hope you can brave up, go on dates, and accept the truth that anybody having any kind of problem with your sexuality is the one with any kind of problem. "
"626",6,"everflow",21,2,4,3,0,"I want to know if the opposite could be true as well. When I was only a child growing up, I already witnessed my grandmothers getting alzheimer's and losing their memories, and even my mother complained she couldn't concentrate on studying anymore, even though she was only in her forties, but she was greatly exaggerating actually; she is still doing fine today.

But then I also saw my father get brain damage and he has lost his memory functions as well (like the guy in the movie Memento, except he doesn't have the drive to motivate himself, he just sits around). 

And from those experiences I got my biggest fear which is memory loss. Even early on, I read on the internet that depression is one of the causes of memory loss. Reading this made me very depressed.

What a stupid vicious circle, I thought. Now I can only live each day trying to hold onto my mental faculties for as long as possible, while every day my fears are growing that they might soon slip away.

I don't know if I will ever find out if my constant worrying will lead to my improvement or deterioration, before it'll be too late."

&gt; New molecules reverse memory loss linked to depression, aging


&gt; In another experiment involving preclinical models of aging, memory declines were rapidly reversed and performance increased to 80 per cent after administration, essentially reaching levels seen in youth or earlier stages of adulthood. This improvement lasted over two months with daily treatment.

&gt; New molecules reverse memory loss linked to depression, aging


&gt; In another experiment involving preclinical models of aging, memory declines were rapidly reversed and performance increased to 80 per cent after administration, essentially reaching levels seen in youth or earlier stages of adulthood. This improvement lasted over two months with daily treatment.

Abstract

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

Basically, maybe how important a person values their memories has an actual impact on retaining them."
"700",5,"kepler456",23,2,4,11,0,"Nope, my depression was because I grew up in a society where it was not acceptable to be gay. There was no trauma, just me worried about coming out and how I would do it. Would I be accepted and stuff like that. It's all done now and all is good. I am not depressed anymore. But, it was never a conscious thing to forget anything. There were no bad memories, just possibilities of bad outcomes. There was nothing that I wanted to forget either consciously or sub-consciously. 

Even today, if I think of a favourite song, I can't name one. I listen to it and I'm like, yes that's the one, it's one of my favourites. 

I definitely agree that the conscious choice has a role to play, but it was not the reason in my case. I can't really socialise point blank because I have no conversation in this sense. Music, sports, movies, that's what people talk about. I saw a really great movie last week, I don't know the name, I know what happened. But then again, I saw all the Harry Potter movies three years ago and I rewatched them a month ago and some of them seemed brand new to me :) I value having these memories because I would be more social with them. But I don't have them.

I do have a high IQ, passed the Mensa test and also have a high empathy score. Logic and learning comes easy, but nothing that needs to stay without logic, if that makes sense? "
"701",44,"Arytek",23,7,5,3,0,"Weird, what you've described fits me to a tee. 

I've always been frustrated by the lack of memory of just basic things. Its as if I can't remember things if they just feel random, like the name of a street or someone's name. It tells me nothing about that street, or about that person, so maybe my mind discards it as information that's not useful. No matter how much I may actually value the thing, this still happens. 

It makes small talk incredibly painful to go through, and Im sure many people get the feeling that I simply don't care since I cant say what my favorite ___ is, cant recall basic info to share with them, or just take longer than usual to recall something. 

However, if its visual, and about how something ""works"" in a logical sense, then I am able to remember it far better. Hence, in classes I can often stuggle in tests to remember everything or do writing assignments, but as soon as someone asks me how something ""works"" then I can go incredibly in-depth. I'll remember very complex info about every topic, but completely lose all of the names/titles.

I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

(I also have high IQ and passed the Mensa test). As a sidenote, I think my IQ is linked to my depression (I read a few things about the effects a high IQ can be isolating in a way, and I feel like having high empathy only makes that harder). "

&gt;I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

Also, some times I think far faster than I can speak and I speak fast, so things get lost in translation. I am sure this is something I can train on, but it does get hard explaining stuff some times. 

The high IQ depression is usually because you cannot find like minded people to converse with. Thankfully I have some of those. Maybe empathy makes it worse, but I cannot imagine not having it :) I am glad I have it. The downside is that I feel sad not just for me alone. "

On another note, your memory mirrors mine in some ways. I'm widely known as brilliant, genius, prodigy, etc. As a software engineer, I can easily think in 10, 12 dimensions for data structures.

I'm 26 and still haven't been on a date. Everyone says I'm a great guy, but I'm shit scared to go out there. I don't know any other gay person. It was hard, really hard, but life hasn't gotten easier :)

"706",6,"everflow",23,2,4,5,0,"I want to know if the opposite could be true as well. When I was only a child growing up, I already witnessed my grandmothers getting alzheimer's and losing their memories, and even my mother complained she couldn't concentrate on studying anymore, even though she was only in her forties, but she was greatly exaggerating actually; she is still doing fine today.

But then I also saw my father get brain damage and he has lost his memory functions as well (like the guy in the movie Memento, except he doesn't have the drive to motivate himself, he just sits around). 

And from those experiences I got my biggest fear which is memory loss. Even early on, I read on the internet that depression is one of the causes of memory loss. Reading this made me very depressed.

What a stupid vicious circle, I thought. Now I can only live each day trying to hold onto my mental faculties for as long as possible, while every day my fears are growing that they might soon slip away.

Abstract

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

Basically, maybe how important a person values their memories has an actual impact on retaining them."
"780",5,"kepler456",25,2,4,9,0,"Nope, my depression was because I grew up in a society where it was not acceptable to be gay. There was no trauma, just me worried about coming out and how I would do it. Would I be accepted and stuff like that. It's all done now and all is good. I am not depressed anymore. But, it was never a conscious thing to forget anything. There were no bad memories, just possibilities of bad outcomes. There was nothing that I wanted to forget either consciously or sub-consciously. 

Even today, if I think of a favourite song, I can't name one. I listen to it and I'm like, yes that's the one, it's one of my favourites. 

I definitely agree that the conscious choice has a role to play, but it was not the reason in my case. I can't really socialise point blank because I have no conversation in this sense. Music, sports, movies, that's what people talk about. I saw a really great movie last week, I don't know the name, I know what happened. But then again, I saw all the Harry Potter movies three years ago and I rewatched them a month ago and some of them seemed brand new to me :) I value having these memories because I would be more social with them. But I don't have them.

I do have a high IQ, passed the Mensa test and also have a high empathy score. Logic and learning comes easy, but nothing that needs to stay without logic, if that makes sense? "
"781",44,"Arytek",25,7,5,3,0,"Weird, what you've described fits me to a tee. 

I've always been frustrated by the lack of memory of just basic things. Its as if I can't remember things if they just feel random, like the name of a street or someone's name. It tells me nothing about that street, or about that person, so maybe my mind discards it as information that's not useful. No matter how much I may actually value the thing, this still happens. 

It makes small talk incredibly painful to go through, and Im sure many people get the feeling that I simply don't care since I cant say what my favorite ___ is, cant recall basic info to share with them, or just take longer than usual to recall something. 

However, if its visual, and about how something ""works"" in a logical sense, then I am able to remember it far better. Hence, in classes I can often stuggle in tests to remember everything or do writing assignments, but as soon as someone asks me how something ""works"" then I can go incredibly in-depth. I'll remember very complex info about every topic, but completely lose all of the names/titles.

I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

(I also have high IQ and passed the Mensa test). As a sidenote, I think my IQ is linked to my depression (I read a few things about the effects a high IQ can be isolating in a way, and I feel like having high empathy only makes that harder). "
"782",45,"kepler456",25,7,44,2,0,"Wow. This resonates with me too:

&gt;I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

Also, some times I think far faster than I can speak and I speak fast, so things get lost in translation. I am sure this is something I can train on, but it does get hard explaining stuff some times. 

The high IQ depression is usually because you cannot find like minded people to converse with. Thankfully I have some of those. Maybe empathy makes it worse, but I cannot imagine not having it :) I am glad I have it. The downside is that I feel sad not just for me alone. "
"783",71,"Arytek",25,17,45,1,0,"The handful of people in my life that I can talk to on that level or at least understand me have also told me that I think incredibly fast, and yeah, not even my talking can really keep up with it sometimes. Whats irhonic is that my mind races like that usually only when there is something I genuinely care about and can affect, AKA around those handful of people since they genuinely care what I have to say and can follow even when the topics seem so disjointed (but aren't to me). One thing I'm in the habit of doing is stopping mid-sentence all of the time, which is usually me realizing that the other person won't 'get' what I'm saying the way I intend them to, so I try to change it up. A part of me wishes I just didn't care, but I can't stand the idea that they might mix up what my intentions were.

My depression has been better in the last few years, but theres still the looming sense that the things/people around me aren't really fulfilling my own needs. Other people in my program know my potential, but only because they see those few instances where I let my mind go full gear because its something I randomly care about.  It sucks to be looked up to by people for the work you do at your best, but to feel like you're failing them the rest of the time because its simply not where your heart/mind is at the time. I'm at the whim of that as immature as it feels, and as much as I've tried to break away from it to do the ""right"" thing. 

Idk, I'm sort of just speaking my mind. I do think that empathy/open-mindedness can keep you too held back. I'm trying to work on that, but I don't know if it's something I can honestly change.  "
"784",55,"MyWholeSelf",25,9,5,2,0,"&gt; There was no trauma, just me worried about coming out and how I would do it.

Dude(ette?), I would argue that the constant state of feeling insecure about something as fundamental as your sexuality is traumatic.

Sorry, that musta been hard...

On another note, your memory mirrors mine in some ways. I'm widely known as brilliant, genius, prodigy, etc. As a software engineer, I can easily think in 10, 12 dimensions for data structures.  But I can't remember movie, song, or actor names to save my life. I don't remember street names, ever, but think spatially and virtually never get lost. "
"785",56,"kepler456",25,9,55,2,0,"Dude here :) Yeah it was. After coming out a few people didn't believe it because I do not fit any of the stereotypes they know about. Well, they learnt something at least lol. I held it in till I was 24. Broke down crying (held up till I left the group) one day when walking home after some friends (we were a new group of friends all in a new country) and I spoke about kids and when they asked me if I have a girlfriend (nothing new, but that day was the last straw). The next day I came out to one in that group. 

I'm 26 and still haven't been on a date. Everyone says I'm a great guy, but I'm shit scared to go out there. I don't know any other gay person. It was hard, really hard, but life hasn't gotten easier :) 

I'm only putting this out there because there are those who read this that would feel more confident about themselves and others who could be more accepting of someone who comes out to them. "
"786",72,"MyWholeSelf",25,19,56,1,0,"Damn, and only out 2 years... 

Good luck, I hope you can brave up, go on dates, and accept the truth that anybody having any kind of problem with your sexuality is the one with any kind of problem. "
"787",6,"everflow",25,2,4,3,0,"I want to know if the opposite could be true as well. When I was only a child growing up, I already witnessed my grandmothers getting alzheimer's and losing their memories, and even my mother complained she couldn't concentrate on studying anymore, even though she was only in her forties, but she was greatly exaggerating actually; she is still doing fine today.

But then I also saw my father get brain damage and he has lost his memory functions as well (like the guy in the movie Memento, except he doesn't have the drive to motivate himself, he just sits around). 

And from those experiences I got my biggest fear which is memory loss. Even early on, I read on the internet that depression is one of the causes of memory loss. Reading this made me very depressed.

What a stupid vicious circle, I thought. Now I can only live each day trying to hold onto my mental faculties for as long as possible, while every day my fears are growing that they might soon slip away.

I don't know if I will ever find out if my constant worrying will lead to my improvement or deterioration, before it'll be too late."

Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory.

But I don't have them.

I do have a high IQ, passed the Mensa test and also have a high empathy score. Logic and learning comes easy, but nothing that needs to stay without logic, if that makes sense? "
"822",44,"Arytek",26,7,5,3,0,"Weird, what you've described fits me to a tee. 

I've always been frustrated by the lack of memory of just basic things. Its as if I can't remember things if they just feel random, like the name of a street or someone's name. It tells me nothing about that street, or about that person, so maybe my mind discards it as information that's not useful. No matter how much I may actually value the thing, this still happens. 

It makes small talk incredibly painful to go through, and Im sure many people get the feeling that I simply don't care since I cant say what my favorite ___ is, cant recall basic info to share with them, or just take longer than usual to recall something. 

However, if its visual, and about how something ""works"" in a logical sense, then I am able to remember it far better. Hence, in classes I can often stuggle in tests to remember everything or do writing assignments, but as soon as someone asks me how something ""works"" then I can go incredibly in-depth. I'll remember very complex info about every topic, but completely lose all of the names/titles.

I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

(I also have high IQ and passed the Mensa test). As a sidenote, I think my IQ is linked to my depression (I read a few things about the effects a high IQ can be isolating in a way, and I feel like having high empathy only makes that harder). "
"823",45,"kepler456",26,7,44,2,0,"Wow. This resonates with me too:

&gt;I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

Also, some times I think far faster than I can speak and I speak fast, so things get lost in translation. I am sure this is something I can train on, but it does get hard explaining stuff some times. 

The high IQ depression is usually because you cannot find like minded people to converse with. Thankfully I have some of those. Maybe empathy makes it worse, but I cannot imagine not having it :) I am glad I have it. The downside is that I feel sad not just for me alone. "
"824",71,"Arytek",26,17,45,1,0,"The handful of people in my life that I can talk to on that level or at least understand me have also told me that I think incredibly fast, and yeah, not even my talking can really keep up with it sometimes. Whats irhonic is that my mind races like that usually only when there is something I genuinely care about and can affect, AKA around those handful of people since they genuinely care what I have to say and can follow even when the topics seem so disjointed (but aren't to me). One thing I'm in the habit of doing is stopping mid-sentence all of the time, which is usually me realizing that the other person won't 'get' what I'm saying the way I intend them to, so I try to change it up. A part of me wishes I just didn't care, but I can't stand the idea that they might mix up what my intentions were.

My depression has been better in the last few years, but theres still the looming sense that the things/people around me aren't really fulfilling my own needs. Other people in my program know my potential, but only because they see those few instances where I let my mind go full gear because its something I randomly care about.  It sucks to be looked up to by people for the work you do at your best, but to feel like you're failing them the rest of the time because its simply not where your heart/mind is at the time. I'm at the whim of that as immature as it feels, and as much as I've tried to break away from it to do the ""right"" thing. 

Idk, I'm sort of just speaking my mind. I do think that empathy/open-mindedness can keep you too held back. I'm trying to work on that, but I don't know if it's something I can honestly change.  "
"825",55,"MyWholeSelf",26,9,5,2,0,"&gt; There was no trauma, just me worried about coming out and how I would do it.

The next day I came out to one in that group. 

I'm 26 and still haven't been on a date. Everyone says I'm a great guy, but I'm shit scared to go out there. I don't know any other gay person. It was hard, really hard, but life hasn't gotten easier :)

"828",6,"everflow",26,2,4,4,0,"I want to know if the opposite could be true as well.

But then I also saw my father get brain damage and he has lost his memory functions as well (like the guy in the movie Memento, except he doesn't have the drive to motivate himself, he just sits around). 

And from those experiences I got my biggest fear which is memory loss. Even early on, I read on the internet that depression is one of the causes of memory loss. Reading this made me very depressed.

What a stupid vicious circle, I thought. Now I can only live each day trying to hold onto my mental faculties for as long as possible, while every day my fears are growing that they might soon slip away.

&gt; New molecules reverse memory loss linked to depression, aging


&gt; In another experiment involving preclinical models of aging, memory declines were rapidly reversed and performance increased to 80 per cent after administration, essentially reaching levels seen in youth or earlier stages of adulthood. This improvement lasted over two months with daily treatment.

Abstract

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

&gt; New molecules reverse memory loss linked to depression, aging


&gt; In another experiment involving preclinical models of aging, memory declines were rapidly reversed and performance increased to 80 per cent after administration, essentially reaching levels seen in youth or earlier stages of adulthood. This improvement lasted over two months with daily treatment.

Abstract

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

There was no trauma, just me worried about coming out and how I would do it. Would I be accepted and stuff like that. It's all done now and all is good. I am not depressed anymore. But, it was never a conscious thing to forget anything. There were no bad memories, just possibilities of bad outcomes. There was nothing that I wanted to forget either consciously or sub-consciously. 

Even today, if I think of a favourite song, I can't name one. I listen to it and I'm like, yes that's the one, it's one of my favourites. 

I definitely agree that the conscious choice has a role to play, but it was not the reason in my case. I can't really socialise point blank because I have no conversation in this sense. Music, sports, movies, that's what people talk about. I saw a really great movie last week, I don't know the name, I know what happened. But then again, I saw all the Harry Potter movies three years ago and I rewatched them a month ago and some of them seemed brand new to me :) I value having these memories because I would be more social with them.

I do have a high IQ, passed the Mensa test and also have a high empathy score. Logic and learning comes easy, but nothing that needs to stay without logic, if that makes sense? "
"904",44,"Arytek",28,7,5,3,0,"Weird, what you've described fits me to a tee. 

I've always been frustrated by the lack of memory of just basic things. Its as if I can't remember things if they just feel random, like the name of a street or someone's name. It tells me nothing about that street, or about that person, so maybe my mind discards it as information that's not useful. No matter how much I may actually value the thing, this still happens. 

It makes small talk incredibly painful to go through, and Im sure many people get the feeling that I simply don't care since I cant say what my favorite ___ is, cant recall basic info to share with them, or just take longer than usual to recall something. 

However, if its visual, and about how something ""works"" in a logical sense, then I am able to remember it far better. Hence, in classes I can often stuggle in tests to remember everything or do writing assignments, but as soon as someone asks me how something ""works"" then I can go incredibly in-depth. I'll remember very complex info about every topic, but completely lose all of the names/titles.

I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

(I also have high IQ and passed the Mensa test). As a sidenote, I think my IQ is linked to my depression (I read a few things about the effects a high IQ can be isolating in a way, and I feel like having high empathy only makes that harder). "

The high IQ depression is usually because you cannot find like minded people to converse with. Thankfully I have some of those. Maybe empathy makes it worse, but I cannot imagine not having it :) I am glad I have it. The downside is that I feel sad not just for me alone. "

Dude(ette?), I would argue that the constant state of feeling insecure about something as fundamental as your sexuality is traumatic.

Sorry, that musta been hard...

On another note, your memory mirrors mine in some ways. I'm widely known as brilliant, genius, prodigy, etc. As a software engineer, I can easily think in 10, 12 dimensions for data structures.  But I can't remember movie, song, or actor names to save my life. I don't remember street names, ever, but think spatially and virtually never get lost. "
"908",56,"kepler456",28,9,55,2,0,"Dude here :) Yeah it was. After coming out a few people didn't believe it because I do not fit any of the stereotypes they know about. Well, they learnt something at least lol. I held it in till I was 24. Broke down crying (held up till I left the group) one day when walking home after some friends (we were a new group of friends all in a new country) and I spoke about kids and when they asked me if I have a girlfriend (nothing new, but that day was the last straw). The next day I came out to one in that group. 

I'm 26 and still haven't been on a date. Everyone says I'm a great guy, but I'm shit scared to go out there. I don't know any other gay person. It was hard, really hard, but life hasn't gotten easier :) 

I'm only putting this out there because there are those who read this that would feel more confident about themselves and others who could be more accepting of someone who comes out to them. "

When I was only a child growing up, I already witnessed my grandmothers getting alzheimer's and losing their memories, and even my mother complained she couldn't concentrate on studying anymore, even though she was only in her forties, but she was greatly exaggerating actually; she is still doing fine today.

But then I also saw my father get brain damage and he has lost his memory functions as well (like the guy in the movie Memento, except he doesn't have the drive to motivate himself, he just sits around). 

And from those experiences I got my biggest fear which is memory loss. Even early on, I read on the internet that depression is one of the causes of memory loss. Reading this made me very depressed.

What a stupid vicious circle, I thought. Now I can only live each day trying to hold onto my mental faculties for as long as possible, while every day my fears are growing that they might soon slip away.

I don't know if I will ever find out if my constant worrying will lead to my improvement or deterioration, before it'll be too late."

I'm 26 and still haven't been on a date. Everyone says I'm a great guy, but I'm shit scared to go out there. I don't know any other gay person. It was hard, really hard, but life hasn't gotten easier :)

But then I also saw my father get brain damage and he has lost his memory functions as well (like the guy in the movie Memento, except he doesn't have the drive to motivate himself, he just sits around). 

And from those experiences I got my biggest fear which is memory loss. Even early on, I read on the internet that depression is one of the causes of memory loss. Reading this made me very depressed.

What a stupid vicious circle, I thought. Now I can only live each day trying to hold onto my mental faculties for as long as possible, while every day my fears are growing that they might soon slip away.

&gt; New molecules reverse memory loss linked to depression, aging


&gt; In another experiment involving preclinical models of aging, memory declines were rapidly reversed and performance increased to 80 per cent after administration, essentially reaching levels seen in youth or earlier stages of adulthood. This improvement lasted over two months with daily treatment.

Abstract

Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function is consistently reported in psychiatric disorders, normal aging, and neurodegenerative disorders and reduced function of GABA interneurons is associated with both mood and cognitive symptoms. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have broad anxiolytic, but also sedative, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects, due to nonspecific GABA-A receptor (GABAA-R) targeting. Varying the profile of activity of BZs at GABAA-Rs is predicted to uncover additional therapeutic potential. We synthesized four novel imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands and tested them for positive allosteric modulation at multiple ±-GABAA-R (±-positive allosteric modulators), pharmacokinetic properties, as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant activities in adult mice. Efficacy at reversing stress-induced or age-related working memory deficits was assessed using a spontaneous alternation task. Diazepam (DZP) was used as a control. Three ligands (GL-II-73, GL-II-74, and GL-II-75) demonstrated adequate brain penetration and showed predictive anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacies. GL-II-73 and GL-II-75 significantly reversed stress-induced and age-related working memory deficits. In contrast, DZP displayed anxiolytic but no antidepressant effects or effects on working memory. We demonstrate distinct profiles of anxiolytic, antidepressant, and/or pro-cognitive activities of newly designed IBZD amide ligands, suggesting novel therapeutic potential for IBZD derivatives in depression and aging."

"985",3,"kepler456",30,1,1,30,0,"Does Depression lead to memory loss? This could explain a lot about why I can't remember certain things: names in particular, lyrics, etc. since my early teens.  "
"986",4,"Ouroboros612",30,2,3,22,0,"The interesting thing to me is if a conscious choice of deeming memories non-important has any impact on your memories. Depressed people tend to want to forget or are apathetic to memories. Maybe neurologically, considering memories pointless has an actual impact on retaining them. Someone not depressed might cherish and want their memories. Someone who is depressed don't care or even want to forget.   
  
Basically, maybe how important a person values their memories has an actual impact on retaining them."
"987",5,"kepler456",30,2,4,10,0,"Nope, my depression was because I grew up in a society where it was not acceptable to be gay. There was no trauma, just me worried about coming out and how I would do it. Would I be accepted and stuff like that. It's all done now and all is good. I am not depressed anymore. But, it was never a conscious thing to forget anything. There were no bad memories, just possibilities of bad outcomes. There was nothing that I wanted to forget either consciously or sub-consciously. 

Even today, if I think of a favourite song, I can't name one. I listen to it and I'm like, yes that's the one, it's one of my favourites. 

I definitely agree that the conscious choice has a role to play, but it was not the reason in my case. I can't really socialise point blank because I have no conversation in this sense. Music, sports, movies, that's what people talk about. I saw a really great movie last week, I don't know the name, I know what happened. But then again, I saw all the Harry Potter movies three years ago and I rewatched them a month ago and some of them seemed brand new to me :) I value having these memories because I would be more social with them. But I don't have them.

I do have a high IQ, passed the Mensa test and also have a high empathy score. Logic and learning comes easy, but nothing that needs to stay without logic, if that makes sense? "
"988",44,"Arytek",30,7,5,3,0,"Weird, what you've described fits me to a tee. 

I've always been frustrated by the lack of memory of just basic things. Its as if I can't remember things if they just feel random, like the name of a street or someone's name. It tells me nothing about that street, or about that person, so maybe my mind discards it as information that's not useful. No matter how much I may actually value the thing, this still happens. 

It makes small talk incredibly painful to go through, and Im sure many people get the feeling that I simply don't care since I cant say what my favorite ___ is, cant recall basic info to share with them, or just take longer than usual to recall something. 

However, if its visual, and about how something ""works"" in a logical sense, then I am able to remember it far better. Hence, in classes I can often stuggle in tests to remember everything or do writing assignments, but as soon as someone asks me how something ""works"" then I can go incredibly in-depth. I'll remember very complex info about every topic, but completely lose all of the names/titles.

I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

(I also have high IQ and passed the Mensa test). As a sidenote, I think my IQ is linked to my depression (I read a few things about the effects a high IQ can be isolating in a way, and I feel like having high empathy only makes that harder). "
"989",45,"kepler456",30,7,44,2,0,"Wow. This resonates with me too:

&gt;I think what sucks is how it essentially strips me of my ability to communicate what I understand sometimes simply because I can't think of the name I'm ""supposed"" to use for this thing I already know/undersand.

Also, some times I think far faster than I can speak and I speak fast, so things get lost in translation. I am sure this is something I can train on, but it does get hard explaining stuff some times. 

The high IQ depression is usually because you cannot find like minded people to converse with. Thankfully I have some of those. Maybe empathy makes it worse, but I cannot imagine not having it :) I am glad I have it. The downside is that I feel sad not just for me alone. "
"990",71,"Arytek",30,17,45,1,0,"The handful of people in my life that I can talk to on that level or at least understand me have also told me that I think incredibly fast, and yeah, not even my talking can really keep up with it sometimes. Whats irhonic is that my mind races like that usually only when there is something I genuinely care about and can affect, AKA around those handful of people since they genuinely care what I have to say and can follow even when the topics seem so disjointed (but aren't to me). One thing I'm in the habit of doing is stopping mid-sentence all of the time, which is usually me realizing that the other person won't 'get' what I'm saying the way I intend them to, so I try to change it up. A part of me wishes I just didn't care, but I can't stand the idea that they might mix up what my intentions were.

My depression has been better in the last few years, but theres still the looming sense that the things/people around me aren't really fulfilling my own needs. Other people in my program know my potential, but only because they see those few instances where I let my mind go full gear because its something I randomly care about.  It sucks to be looked up to by people for the work you do at your best, but to feel like you're failing them the rest of the time because its simply not where your heart/mind is at the time. I'm at the whim of that as immature as it feels, and as much as I've tried to break away from it to do the ""right"" thing.
