Delayed Phase Sleep Disorder becomes not an annoyance, but a straight up societal disability. If youre very lucky, night owls can day walk with heavy sleep meds and stimulants. For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

Hell, many DSPD people struggle with being able to get to doctors appointments because of the limited hours clinics are open.

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

Delayed Phase Sleep Disorder becomes not an annoyance, but a straight up societal disability. If youre very lucky, night owls can day walk with heavy sleep meds and stimulants. For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

Hell, many DSPD people struggle with being able to get to doctors appointments because of the limited hours clinics are open.

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

&gt; Stop worrying about the world conforming for you, 

I don't think a lot of night owls care so much about society confirming in itself, I think they are more preoccupied with being damned tired.

&gt; and just live your life the way you want. 

Come on, there are limits to how much choice an individual has. Those limits might be much less now than in earlier times or other societies, but they are still there and very real.

"536",233,"snoboreddotcom",8,7,1,1,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."
"537",235,"AldrS",8,7,1,1,0,"I don't believe in the concept of a ""night owl"" anymore. I used to, I thought I was one.

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution. Humans are more adaptable and durable that one might imagine. So yes, I do believe you can choose to stop being a night owl, it just comes with the price tag of hard unpleasant training.  Question is are you willing to pay that for a better life?"

A month later I was up and about two minutes before the alarm began ringing.

For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

"679",158,"snoboreddotcom",9,6,1,1,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility.

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution. Humans are more adaptable and durable that one might imagine. So yes, I do believe you can choose to stop being a night owl, it just comes with the price tag of hard unpleasant training.

If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

"849",162,"snoboreddotcom",10,6,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility.

Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

&gt; Stop worrying about the world conforming for you, 

I don't think a lot of night owls care so much about society confirming in itself, I think they are more preoccupied with being damned tired.

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution.

If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

Hell, many DSPD people struggle with being able to get to doctors appointments because of the limited hours clinics are open.

"997",119,"MySilverWhining",11,5,1,1,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"1039",163,"snoboreddotcom",11,6,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

&gt; Stop worrying about the world conforming for you, 

I don't think a lot of night owls care so much about society confirming in itself, I think they are more preoccupied with being damned tired.

&gt; and just live your life the way you want. 

Come on, there are limits to how much choice an individual has. Those limits might be much less now than in earlier times or other societies, but they are still there and very real.

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution.

For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it.

For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

"1404",119,"MySilverWhining",13,5,1,4,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

"1619",119,"MySilverWhining",14,5,1,3,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"1894",226,"snoboreddotcom",15,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution. Humans are more adaptable and durable that one might imagine. So yes, I do believe you can choose to stop being a night owl, it just comes with the price tag of hard unpleasant training.

For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time. Its amazing how many things they take for granted. Which makes it even more infuriating when many accuse night owls of it being a choice. "

I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"2130",226,"snoboreddotcom",16,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility.

"2172",598,"AldrS",16,14,1,1,0,"I don't believe in the concept of a ""night owl"" anymore. I used to, I thought I was one. Usual things like couldn't fall asleep at night, awake till 3-4 AM, couldn't get up in the morning, always late for work, spending the 1st part of the day having 3-4 coffees and just being a zombie all around. Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution. Humans are more adaptable and durable that one might imagine. So yes, I do believe you can choose to stop being a night owl, it just comes with the price tag of hard unpleasant training.  Question is are you willing to pay that for a better life?"
"2173",693,"lupuscapabilis",16,16,598,1,0,"Some people have a job where they don't have to think that much in the morning.

Sure, if I had to work from 9-5 every day, I could... but most people at my company aren't doing complex coding at 9 am. They're sending emails like ""hey is this done yet?"" Anyone can do that at 8, 9am.

It's sort of like hiring someone to write a book and telling them they can only write from 9-5. Who cares when they write? They should be able to do their work when they do their best work, not limited by hours just because.

I started sleeping like a nazi. 8 hours minimum, no exception no fuckups noone can even come close to disrupt me in this time.

If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"2383",227,"snoboreddotcom",17,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

For people with chronic illnesses, getting up hours early, or trying to stay up all night, to make the appointment, means days or more of their conditions flaring and putting them in pain and misery.

How much effort have individuals put into turning on the CRY1 gene is my question, and can it be turned off. All of evolution has developed along with circadian rhythm. People that arent in balance may have worked towards flipping that gene, or being born into it cause their parents worked towards it. Staying up late, eating late night meals, taking jobs with late night shifts. I was once a night owl. Are people just accepting that insomnia is how they're wired? This is ridiculous. Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"2536",722,"raiinboweyes",18,18,476,1,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

"2539",24,"MySilverWhining",18,2,1,10,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Anyone can do that at 8, 9am.

It's sort of like hiring someone to write a book and telling them they can only write from 9-5. Who cares when they write? They should be able to do their work when they do their best work, not limited by hours just because.

I do agree that anyone can change their schedule, I just don't agree that everyone works best on that schedule. "

In my experience though, 5(+2) years 4:20am wakeup when my brain feels like it could be time for bed in 1-2 hours, it fucks with you in the long run.

I started sleeping like a nazi. 8 hours minimum, no exception no fuckups noone can even come close to disrupt me in this time.

People that arent in balance may have worked towards flipping that gene, or being born into it cause their parents worked towards it. Staying up late, eating late night meals, taking jobs with late night shifts. I was once a night owl. Are people just accepting that insomnia is how they're wired? This is ridiculous. Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"2795",722,"raiinboweyes",19,18,476,1,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

"2798",24,"MySilverWhining",19,2,1,12,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"2900",227,"snoboreddotcom",19,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

It all works out great.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution. Humans are more adaptable and durable that one might imagine. So yes, I do believe you can choose to stop being a night owl, it just comes with the price tag of hard unpleasant training.  Question is are you willing to pay that for a better life?"

As a website developer, most of my best work comes later in the day and that's how I feel I should be utilized. Sure, if I had to work from 9-5 every day, I could... but most people at my company aren't doing complex coding at 9 am. They're sending emails like ""hey is this done yet?"" Anyone can do that at 8, 9am.

It's sort of like hiring someone to write a book and telling them they can only write from 9-5. Who cares when they write? They should be able to do their work when they do their best work, not limited by hours just because.

"3023",3,"MySilverWhining",20,1,1,15,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

People that arent in balance may have worked towards flipping that gene, or being born into it cause their parents worked towards it. Staying up late, eating late night meals, taking jobs with late night shifts. I was once a night owl. Are people just accepting that insomnia is how they're wired? This is ridiculous. Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"3062",801,"raiinboweyes",20,20,800,1,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

"3167",227,"snoboreddotcom",20,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

I spent 3 years working 7-3 and 2 years working 8-5. 5 years in total and I did the same thing; went to bed early, got 7-8 hours of sleep, kept the schedule on the off days. I never adjusted. Every day was like dragging my ass out of bed and every day I felt exhausted. Thought I had a sleeping problem or bad mattress until I changed to 3-11. 2 years into it and I wouldn't change a thing.

"3212",669,"AldrS",20,15,1,1,0,"I don't believe in the concept of a ""night owl"" anymore. I used to, I thought I was one. Usual things like couldn't fall asleep at night, awake till 3-4 AM, couldn't get up in the morning, always late for work, spending the 1st part of the day having 3-4 coffees and just being a zombie all around. Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution. Humans are more adaptable and durable that one might imagine. So yes, I do believe you can choose to stop being a night owl, it just comes with the price tag of hard unpleasant training.  Question is are you willing to pay that for a better life?"

Sure, if I had to work from 9-5 every day, I could... but most people at my company aren't doing complex coding at 9 am. They're sending emails like ""hey is this done yet?"" Anyone can do that at 8, 9am.

It's sort of like hiring someone to write a book and telling them they can only write from 9-5. Who cares when they write? They should be able to do their work when they do their best work, not limited by hours just because.

"3291",3,"MySilverWhining",21,1,1,17,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

People that arent in balance may have worked towards flipping that gene, or being born into it cause their parents worked towards it. Staying up late, eating late night meals, taking jobs with late night shifts. I was once a night owl. Are people just accepting that insomnia is how they're wired? This is ridiculous. Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"3330",801,"raiinboweyes",21,20,800,1,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

I got tired of always spending the first couple of hours tired, so I made the decision to go to bed earlier to get the 8 hours of sleep I need, to start getting ready for bed earlier so I don't spend an hour trying to go to sleep, and to maintain the same sleep pattern even on weekends. A month later I was up and about two minutes before the alarm began ringing.  
I have nothing to base this idea on than my own anecdote, but I'm convinced the night owl syndrome is just subjective, is just a label. Would honestly be interested in some factual study that supports the biological difference that makes people earlybirds/nightowls, if there is any."

I spent 3 years working 7-3 and 2 years working 8-5. 5 years in total and I did the same thing; went to bed early, got 7-8 hours of sleep, kept the schedule on the off days. I never adjusted.

Usual things like couldn't fall asleep at night, awake till 3-4 AM, couldn't get up in the morning, always late for work, spending the 1st part of the day having 3-4 coffees and just being a zombie all around. Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution. Humans are more adaptable and durable that one might imagine. So yes, I do believe you can choose to stop being a night owl, it just comes with the price tag of hard unpleasant training.  Question is are you willing to pay that for a better life?"

Sure, if I had to work from 9-5 every day, I could... but most people at my company aren't doing complex coding at 9 am. They're sending emails like ""hey is this done yet?"" Anyone can do that at 8, 9am.

It's sort of like hiring someone to write a book and telling them they can only write from 9-5. Who cares when they write? They should be able to do their work when they do their best work, not limited by hours just because.

I started sleeping like a nazi. 8 hours minimum, no exception no fuckups noone can even come close to disrupt me in this time.

"3559",3,"MySilverWhining",22,1,1,20,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

People that arent in balance may have worked towards flipping that gene, or being born into it cause their parents worked towards it. Staying up late, eating late night meals, taking jobs with late night shifts. I was once a night owl. Are people just accepting that insomnia is how they're wired? This is ridiculous. Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"3599",801,"raiinboweyes",22,20,800,1,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

A month later I was up and about two minutes before the alarm began ringing.

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution.

But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

Delayed Phase Sleep Disorder becomes not an annoyance, but a straight up societal disability. If youre very lucky, night owls can day walk with heavy sleep meds and stimulants. For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

How much effort have individuals put into turning on the CRY1 gene is my question, and can it be turned off. All of evolution has developed along with circadian rhythm. People that arent in balance may have worked towards flipping that gene, or being born into it cause their parents worked towards it. Staying up late, eating late night meals, taking jobs with late night shifts. I was once a night owl. Are people just accepting that insomnia is how they're wired? This is ridiculous. Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"3868",801,"raiinboweyes",23,20,800,1,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

A month later I was up and about two minutes before the alarm began ringing.

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution.

"4097",3,"MySilverWhining",24,1,1,21,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

People that arent in balance may have worked towards flipping that gene, or being born into it cause their parents worked towards it. Staying up late, eating late night meals, taking jobs with late night shifts. I was once a night owl. Are people just accepting that insomnia is how they're wired? This is ridiculous. Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"4137",801,"raiinboweyes",24,20,800,1,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

"4243",232,"snoboreddotcom",24,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

&gt; Stop worrying about the world conforming for you, 

I don't think a lot of night owls care so much about society confirming in itself, I think they are more preoccupied with being damned tired.

&gt; and just live your life the way you want. 

Come on, there are limits to how much choice an individual has. Those limits might be much less now than in earlier times or other societies, but they are still there and very real.

A month later I was up and about two minutes before the alarm began ringing.

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework.

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution.

"4366",3,"MySilverWhining",25,1,1,21,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"4406",801,"raiinboweyes",25,20,800,1,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

"4512",232,"snoboreddotcom",25,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

&gt; Stop worrying about the world conforming for you, 

I don't think a lot of night owls care so much about society confirming in itself, I think they are more preoccupied with being damned tired.

&gt; and just live your life the way you want. 

Come on, there are limits to how much choice an individual has. Those limits might be much less now than in earlier times or other societies, but they are still there and very real.

A month later I was up and about two minutes before the alarm began ringing.

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution.

It's sort of like hiring someone to write a book and telling them they can only write from 9-5. Who cares when they write? They should be able to do their work when they do their best work, not limited by hours just because.

"4636",3,"MySilverWhining",26,1,1,21,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"4676",801,"raiinboweyes",26,20,800,1,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

"4906",3,"MySilverWhining",27,1,1,20,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

"4946",801,"raiinboweyes",27,20,800,1,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

"4949",60,"_Z_E_R_O",27,4,59,29,0,"&gt; My advice to everyone, discipline yourself when it's still easy.

I'm in my 30s. It's never been easy for me.

My only solution is to either work nights or pull one all-nighter every few days to get on a normal schedule. "
"4950",61,"MacNulty",27,4,60,-8,0,"Delayed sleep phase disorder? Get yourself some melatonin. Wear an eye mask. Don't use smartphone in bed. Meditate before sleeping. I know these things are platitudes at this point but they work.

&amp;#x200B;"
"4951",62,"shamrocky12",27,4,61,11,0,"The above methods do not work for someone with DPSD. The body has a different circadian rythym than ""normal"" people. That would be like asking people with a ""normal""  sleep schedule to train their body to get tired at 4pm every day. It isn't going to happen no matter what  they do because it goes against their bodies natural order. There have been numerous studies done on this. There is a Harvard sleep medicine department dedicated specifically to studying people with DPSD.
"
"4952",63,"MacNulty",27,4,62,1,0,"Interesting. I think I suffer from dpsd as well (no official diagnosis) and these things help. However it only takes one weekend late party and my schedule goes back tohell. "
"4953",64,"shamrocky12",27,4,63,6,0,"Yeah that's the problem. You can do things, like you mentioned, to help force the issue, however, the body always returns back to it's natural state. I fought that losing battle for decades before finally realizing no amount of habit forming, discipline, drugs etc. would ever change my natural circadian rythym. All I was doing was deluding myself into thinking I could win a losing battle. "
"4954",65,"MacNulty",27,4,64,4,0,"Yeah, in hindsight I never actually ""fixed"" my problem either, I only have periods when I go to bed early but it kind of requires conscious effort. As soon as I stop paying attention to it I revert back to ""normal"".

Embracing it and reorganising my life will probably save me tons of energy."
"4955",66,"shamrocky12",27,4,65,5,0,"If you can, I highly recommend doing so. If you have DPSD, even if/when you manage to get 7-8 hours of sleep, you're brain will still not be functioning at it's normal capacity during early morning hours. You just end up lopping off more productive hours at the end of your day that you could otherwise be enjoying."
"4956",723,"MacNulty",27,18,66,2,0,"Yeah, the only problem is the social aspect. DPSD leaves me with the feeling that I am out of alignment with my surroundings.... as if I was always coming late to the party, and staying at it longer than everyone else. I may be more ""efficient"" this way but also a bit depressed that I can't fit in whereas if I fix my schedule I feel like I fit in but can't work at 100% capacity, feel sluggish and inferior to others. Unfortunately the world doesn't revolve around me so it's a tough compromise."
"4957",724,"_Z_E_R_O",27,18,61,23,0,"At this point I dont care about fixing it. Ive adjusted my entire schedule to match my sleep cycle and couldnt be happier.  

I was tired (lol) of having months of discipline and sleep techniques reset by a single weekend. I finally decided to listen to my body. 

I sleep better in the daytime, and that will never change. Forcing myself to sleep at night was having a detrimental effect on my life. "
"4958",725,"BenScotti_",27,18,61,1,0,"Yeah unfortunately it doesn't work that way. Doctor says I simply run on another circadian rhythm than most people. It's common with ADHD. Also cannot take melatonin due to thyroid disorders. I was told that I would never be able to train myself to run on a normal cycle and that my best option is to find a graveyard shift job, otherwise I'll just whittle down my lifespan. "

"5053",233,"snoboreddotcom",27,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

"5214",865,"raiinboweyes",28,28,864,1,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

"5217",90,"_Z_E_R_O",28,5,25,28,0,"&gt; My advice to everyone, discipline yourself when it's still easy.

I'm in my 30s. It's never been easy for me.

My only solution is to either work nights or pull one all-nighter every few days to get on a normal schedule. "
"5218",187,"MacNulty",28,7,90,-9,0,"Delayed sleep phase disorder? Get yourself some melatonin. Wear an eye mask. Don't use smartphone in bed. Meditate before sleeping. I know these things are platitudes at this point but they work.

&amp;#x200B;"
"5219",188,"shamrocky12",28,7,187,12,0,"The above methods do not work for someone with DPSD. The body has a different circadian rythym than ""normal"" people. That would be like asking people with a ""normal""  sleep schedule to train their body to get tired at 4pm every day. It isn't going to happen no matter what  they do because it goes against their bodies natural order. There have been numerous studies done on this. There is a Harvard sleep medicine department dedicated specifically to studying people with DPSD.
"
"5220",604,"MacNulty",28,15,188,1,0,"Interesting. I think I suffer from dpsd as well (no official diagnosis) and these things help. However it only takes one weekend late party and my schedule goes back tohell. "
"5221",605,"shamrocky12",28,15,604,5,0,"Yeah that's the problem. You can do things, like you mentioned, to help force the issue, however, the body always returns back to it's natural state. I fought that losing battle for decades before finally realizing no amount of habit forming, discipline, drugs etc. would ever change my natural circadian rythym. All I was doing was deluding myself into thinking I could win a losing battle. "
"5222",606,"MacNulty",28,15,605,5,0,"Yeah, in hindsight I never actually ""fixed"" my problem either, I only have periods when I go to bed early but it kind of requires conscious effort. As soon as I stop paying attention to it I revert back to ""normal"".

Embracing it and reorganising my life will probably save me tons of energy."
"5223",607,"shamrocky12",28,15,606,5,0,"If you can, I highly recommend doing so. If you have DPSD, even if/when you manage to get 7-8 hours of sleep, you're brain will still not be functioning at it's normal capacity during early morning hours. You just end up lopping off more productive hours at the end of your day that you could otherwise be enjoying."
"5224",608,"MacNulty",28,15,607,2,0,"Yeah, the only problem is the social aspect. DPSD leaves me with the feeling that I am out of alignment with my surroundings.... as if I was always coming late to the party, and staying at it longer than everyone else. I may be more ""efficient"" this way but also a bit depressed that I can't fit in whereas if I fix my schedule I feel like I fit in but can't work at 100% capacity, feel sluggish and inferior to others. Unfortunately the world doesn't revolve around me so it's a tough compromise."
"5225",609,"_Z_E_R_O",28,15,187,22,0,"At this point I dont care about fixing it. Ive adjusted my entire schedule to match my sleep cycle and couldnt be happier.  

I was tired (lol) of having months of discipline and sleep techniques reset by a single weekend. I finally decided to listen to my body. 

I sleep better in the daytime, and that will never change. Forcing myself to sleep at night was having a detrimental effect on my life. "
"5226",610,"BenScotti_",28,15,187,1,0,"Yeah unfortunately it doesn't work that way. Doctor says I simply run on another circadian rhythm than most people. It's common with ADHD. Also cannot take melatonin due to thyroid disorders. I was told that I would never be able to train myself to run on a normal cycle and that my best option is to find a graveyard shift job, otherwise I'll just whittle down my lifespan. "
"5227",611,"Rickard403",28,15,187,-1,0,"I take on this mentality as well. What are we doing about it? Are we just laying back and accepting night owl as a condition? If you're young im willing to bet things can be done to correct insomnia before it gets to the point of altering genes. "
"5228",91,"manamorgan",28,5,25,5,0,"I second this and my career has flexible hours. I would way rather work like a 10-5 shift than a 7-3 "
"5229",48,"MySilverWhining",28,3,1,19,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"5323",233,"snoboreddotcom",28,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

How much effort have individuals put into turning on the CRY1 gene is my question, and can it be turned off. All of evolution has developed along with circadian rhythm. People that arent in balance may have worked towards flipping that gene, or being born into it cause their parents worked towards it. Staying up late, eating late night meals, taking jobs with late night shifts. I was once a night owl. Are people just accepting that insomnia is how they're wired? This is ridiculous. Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"5484",865,"raiinboweyes",29,28,864,1,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

I'm in my 30s. It's never been easy for me.

My only solution is to either work nights or pull one all-nighter every few days to get on a normal schedule. "
"5488",187,"MacNulty",29,7,90,-9,0,"Delayed sleep phase disorder? Get yourself some melatonin. Wear an eye mask. Don't use smartphone in bed. Meditate before sleeping. I know these things are platitudes at this point but they work.

&amp;#x200B;"
"5489",188,"shamrocky12",29,7,187,12,0,"The above methods do not work for someone with DPSD. The body has a different circadian rythym than ""normal"" people. That would be like asking people with a ""normal""  sleep schedule to train their body to get tired at 4pm every day. It isn't going to happen no matter what  they do because it goes against their bodies natural order. There have been numerous studies done on this. There is a Harvard sleep medicine department dedicated specifically to studying people with DPSD.
"
"5490",604,"MacNulty",29,15,188,1,0,"Interesting. I think I suffer from dpsd as well (no official diagnosis) and these things help. However it only takes one weekend late party and my schedule goes back tohell. "
"5491",605,"shamrocky12",29,15,604,5,0,"Yeah that's the problem. You can do things, like you mentioned, to help force the issue, however, the body always returns back to it's natural state. I fought that losing battle for decades before finally realizing no amount of habit forming, discipline, drugs etc. would ever change my natural circadian rythym. All I was doing was deluding myself into thinking I could win a losing battle. "
"5492",606,"MacNulty",29,15,605,4,0,"Yeah, in hindsight I never actually ""fixed"" my problem either, I only have periods when I go to bed early but it kind of requires conscious effort. As soon as I stop paying attention to it I revert back to ""normal"".

Embracing it and reorganising my life will probably save me tons of energy."
"5493",607,"shamrocky12",29,15,606,3,0,"If you can, I highly recommend doing so. If you have DPSD, even if/when you manage to get 7-8 hours of sleep, you're brain will still not be functioning at it's normal capacity during early morning hours. You just end up lopping off more productive hours at the end of your day that you could otherwise be enjoying."
"5494",608,"MacNulty",29,15,607,2,0,"Yeah, the only problem is the social aspect. DPSD leaves me with the feeling that I am out of alignment with my surroundings.... as if I was always coming late to the party, and staying at it longer than everyone else. I may be more ""efficient"" this way but also a bit depressed that I can't fit in whereas if I fix my schedule I feel like I fit in but can't work at 100% capacity, feel sluggish and inferior to others. Unfortunately the world doesn't revolve around me so it's a tough compromise."
"5495",609,"_Z_E_R_O",29,15,187,22,0,"At this point I dont care about fixing it. Ive adjusted my entire schedule to match my sleep cycle and couldnt be happier.  

I was tired (lol) of having months of discipline and sleep techniques reset by a single weekend. I finally decided to listen to my body. 

I sleep better in the daytime, and that will never change. Forcing myself to sleep at night was having a detrimental effect on my life. "
"5496",610,"BenScotti_",29,15,187,1,0,"Yeah unfortunately it doesn't work that way. Doctor says I simply run on another circadian rhythm than most people. It's common with ADHD. Also cannot take melatonin due to thyroid disorders. I was told that I would never be able to train myself to run on a normal cycle and that my best option is to find a graveyard shift job, otherwise I'll just whittle down my lifespan. "
"5497",611,"Rickard403",29,15,187,-1,0,"I take on this mentality as well. What are we doing about it? Are we just laying back and accepting night owl as a condition? If you're young im willing to bet things can be done to correct insomnia before it gets to the point of altering genes. "

"5499",48,"MySilverWhining",29,3,1,19,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"5593",233,"snoboreddotcom",29,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

Many night owls can not find the work that would fit the needs for both their chronic conditions and their circadian rhythm. Meaning the without all of the opportunities that daywalkers have, they find themselves unable to work. 

Hell, many DSPD people struggle with being able to get to doctors appointments because of the limited hours clinics are open. For people with chronic illnesses, getting up hours early, or trying to stay up all night, to make the appointment, means days or more of their conditions flaring and putting them in pain and misery.

People that arent in balance may have worked towards flipping that gene, or being born into it cause their parents worked towards it. Staying up late, eating late night meals, taking jobs with late night shifts. I was once a night owl. Are people just accepting that insomnia is how they're wired? This is ridiculous. Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"5753",865,"raiinboweyes",30,28,864,1,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"5862",233,"snoboreddotcom",30,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Usual things like couldn't fall asleep at night, awake till 3-4 AM, couldn't get up in the morning, always late for work, spending the 1st part of the day having 3-4 coffees and just being a zombie all around. Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution. Humans are more adaptable and durable that one might imagine. So yes, I do believe you can choose to stop being a night owl, it just comes with the price tag of hard unpleasant training.  Question is are you willing to pay that for a better life?"
"5906",695,"lupuscapabilis",30,16,669,1,0,"Some people have a job where they don't have to think that much in the morning. As a website developer, most of my best work comes later in the day and that's how I feel I should be utilized. Sure, if I had to work from 9-5 every day, I could... but most people at my company aren't doing complex coding at 9 am. They're sending emails like ""hey is this done yet?"" Anyone can do that at 8, 9am.

It's sort of like hiring someone to write a book and telling them they can only write from 9-5. Who cares when they write? They should be able to do their work when they do their best work, not limited by hours just because.

If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

People that arent in balance may have worked towards flipping that gene, or being born into it cause their parents worked towards it. Staying up late, eating late night meals, taking jobs with late night shifts. I was once a night owl. Are people just accepting that insomnia is how they're wired? This is ridiculous. Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"6022",865,"raiinboweyes",31,28,864,1,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

"6037",48,"MySilverWhining",31,3,1,20,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"6134",235,"snoboreddotcom",31,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

I spent 3 years working 7-3 and 2 years working 8-5. 5 years in total and I did the same thing; went to bed early, got 7-8 hours of sleep, kept the schedule on the off days. I never adjusted. Every day was like dragging my ass out of bed and every day I felt exhausted. Thought I had a sleeping problem or bad mattress until I changed to 3-11. 2 years into it and I wouldn't change a thing.

"6173",666,"AldrS",31,15,1,0,0,"I don't believe in the concept of a ""night owl"" anymore. I used to, I thought I was one. Usual things like couldn't fall asleep at night, awake till 3-4 AM, couldn't get up in the morning, always late for work, spending the 1st part of the day having 3-4 coffees and just being a zombie all around. Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution. Humans are more adaptable and durable that one might imagine. So yes, I do believe you can choose to stop being a night owl, it just comes with the price tag of hard unpleasant training.  Question is are you willing to pay that for a better life?"

Sure, if I had to work from 9-5 every day, I could... but most people at my company aren't doing complex coding at 9 am. They're sending emails like ""hey is this done yet?"" Anyone can do that at 8, 9am.

It's sort of like hiring someone to write a book and telling them they can only write from 9-5. Who cares when they write? They should be able to do their work when they do their best work, not limited by hours just because.

I started sleeping like a nazi. 8 hours minimum, no exception no fuckups noone can even come close to disrupt me in this time.

For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

People that arent in balance may have worked towards flipping that gene, or being born into it cause their parents worked towards it. Staying up late, eating late night meals, taking jobs with late night shifts. I was once a night owl. Are people just accepting that insomnia is how they're wired? This is ridiculous. Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"6292",865,"raiinboweyes",32,28,864,2,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

"6307",48,"MySilverWhining",32,3,1,21,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"6405",235,"snoboreddotcom",32,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Having 4-hour workdays 6 days a week would probably improve the quantity and quality of actual useful work getting done while cutting work hours by 40%.

But the point is not to maximize the productivity of working hours. The point is to minimize the amount of free time and energy that workers have and maximize the amount of control that corporate management has over the lives of the less-than-wealthy. This is why managers keep trying to make workdays longer despite scientists repeatedly telling us to make workdays shorter. It's also why the workday is kept as rigid as possible and not adapted to the different needs of different people."

My least favorite shift ever was 4 am to 2 pm. It was like going to the airport every morning and getting home from school early every night. Really weird.

My best shift ever was from 4 pm to 2 am. Fucking GREAT shift. I went to bed the moment I got home from work, I was always up and able to go out with friends on the weekends, and I got loads of shit done in the mornings when I first woke up.

A month later I was up and about two minutes before the alarm began ringing.

"6444",666,"AldrS",32,15,1,0,0,"I don't believe in the concept of a ""night owl"" anymore. I used to, I thought I was one. Usual things like couldn't fall asleep at night, awake till 3-4 AM, couldn't get up in the morning, always late for work, spending the 1st part of the day having 3-4 coffees and just being a zombie all around. Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution. Humans are more adaptable and durable that one might imagine. So yes, I do believe you can choose to stop being a night owl, it just comes with the price tag of hard unpleasant training.

Anyone can do that at 8, 9am.

It's sort of like hiring someone to write a book and telling them they can only write from 9-5. Who cares when they write? They should be able to do their work when they do their best work, not limited by hours just because.

I started sleeping like a nazi. 8 hours minimum, no exception no fuckups noone can even come close to disrupt me in this time.

For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

Staying up late, eating late night meals, taking jobs with late night shifts. I was once a night owl. Are people just accepting that insomnia is how they're wired? This is ridiculous. Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"6563",865,"raiinboweyes",33,28,864,2,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"6676",235,"snoboreddotcom",33,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

A month later I was up and about two minutes before the alarm began ringing.

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever! After like 20+ years of calling myself a ""night owl"" I feel I'm finally free. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework. It all works out great.

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution.

For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

Staying up late, eating late night meals, taking jobs with late night shifts. I was once a night owl. Are people just accepting that insomnia is how they're wired? This is ridiculous. Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"6834",865,"raiinboweyes",34,28,864,2,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"6947",235,"snoboreddotcom",34,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

&gt; Stop worrying about the world conforming for you, 

I don't think a lot of night owls care so much about society confirming in itself, I think they are more preoccupied with being damned tired.

&gt; and just live your life the way you want. 

Come on, there are limits to how much choice an individual has. Those limits might be much less now than in earlier times or other societies, but they are still there and very real.

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it. Took me 3-4 months, of which the first one was really bad, but gradually got easier. Now I wake up at around 6AM without setting an alarm. I sleep better than ever!

Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those super healthy super fit extremely driven people, I work an office job and I'm fairly out of shape, but this change in sleeping habits made me a lot happier.  The mornings are my most productive hours. I can work on my own projects, spend time with the family, work out a bit once in a while (in ""night owl"" mode I went to the gym 0 times) or simply entertain myself by reading or catching up on some Netflix homework.

Not to say that the 9 to 5 is ok or there is nothing wrong with our society, but that is another rant that I do not wish to get into now, but I also do believe that we are too quick to put labels on ourselves and blame society for our problems rather than put in the work for a solution.

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

"7105",865,"raiinboweyes",35,28,864,2,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill.

I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

&gt; Stop worrying about the world conforming for you, 

I don't think a lot of night owls care so much about society confirming in itself, I think they are more preoccupied with being damned tired.

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it.

If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

"7376",865,"raiinboweyes",36,28,864,2,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"7486",235,"snoboreddotcom",36,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

&gt; Stop worrying about the world conforming for you, 

I don't think a lot of night owls care so much about society confirming in itself, I think they are more preoccupied with being damned tired.

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough!

Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it.

If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

"7644",865,"raiinboweyes",37,28,864,2,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

"7659",48,"MySilverWhining",37,3,1,22,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"7754",235,"snoboreddotcom",37,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

&gt; Stop worrying about the world conforming for you, 

I don't think a lot of night owls care so much about society confirming in itself, I think they are more preoccupied with being damned tired.

Staying late at work to actually do my job. Constantly felt like shit, had no life, it was horrible. So at one point I said enough! I trained myself, my mind and my body to get up early and go to bed early. It was VERY hard! Basically no fancy science or special techniques, I just got the F\*\*\* up every morning, even when I didn't want to. It was a truly shitty experience. But I did it until I got used to it.

For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"7912",865,"raiinboweyes",38,28,864,2,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

"7927",48,"MySilverWhining",38,3,1,22,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"8022",235,"snoboreddotcom",38,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

Staying up late, eating late night meals, taking jobs with late night shifts. I was once a night owl. Are people just accepting that insomnia is how they're wired? This is ridiculous. Everyone in here needs to look into the Circadian Code by Dr Panda"
"8181",865,"raiinboweyes",39,28,864,2,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

"8196",48,"MySilverWhining",39,3,1,23,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"8291",235,"snoboreddotcom",39,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

For many, no treatments work because they are fighting their genetics (discovered to be a CRY1 gene mutation by Rockefeller University) and that is a constant uphill battle (with a lot of sleep deprivation) at best. 
If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

"8450",865,"raiinboweyes",40,28,864,2,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

"8457",605,"shamrocky12",40,15,604,5,0,"Yeah that's the problem. You can do things, like you mentioned, to help force the issue, however, the body always returns back to it's natural state. I fought that losing battle for decades before finally realizing no amount of habit forming, discipline, drugs etc. would ever change my natural circadian rythym. All I was doing was deluding myself into thinking I could win a losing battle. "
"8458",606,"MacNulty",40,15,605,3,0,"Yeah, in hindsight I never actually ""fixed"" my problem either, I only have periods when I go to bed early but it kind of requires conscious effort. As soon as I stop paying attention to it I revert back to ""normal"".

Embracing it and reorganising my life will probably save me tons of energy."
"8459",607,"shamrocky12",40,15,606,4,0,"If you can, I highly recommend doing so. If you have DPSD, even if/when you manage to get 7-8 hours of sleep, you're brain will still not be functioning at it's normal capacity during early morning hours. You just end up lopping off more productive hours at the end of your day that you could otherwise be enjoying."
"8460",608,"MacNulty",40,15,607,2,0,"Yeah, the only problem is the social aspect. DPSD leaves me with the feeling that I am out of alignment with my surroundings.... as if I was always coming late to the party, and staying at it longer than everyone else. I may be more ""efficient"" this way but also a bit depressed that I can't fit in whereas if I fix my schedule I feel like I fit in but can't work at 100% capacity, feel sluggish and inferior to others. Unfortunately the world doesn't revolve around me so it's a tough compromise."

"8465",48,"MySilverWhining",40,3,1,22,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"8560",235,"snoboreddotcom",40,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)

If they manage to day walk, they are hurting their long and short term health by doing this. But many have to, because they cannot be secure without a job during their night (or societys day).

Daywalkers have no earthly idea what kind of privilege they have by being able to function on a normal schedule- the world has been built to run on their time.

"8719",865,"raiinboweyes",41,28,864,2,0,"It's not insomnia. DSPDers get their 8ish hours of sleep, just on a delayed schedule. That is not insomnia. Ask a group of DSPSers when they feel they wake up and when they feel sleepy. The common answer is they start to feel truly awake when the sun goes down, and feel sleepy when it comes up. Their schedules are dictated by the sun, just the opposite of daywalkers.   
I know myself and every person in the DSPD groups I've seen has tried or are currently trying every treatment and lifestyle change there is, in an attempt to see if they can ""fix"" their schedule. These groups are constantly sharing academic papers and peer reviewed scientific journals, trying to find something to break the code to something that could actually help.   
I wrote out a list of how many treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes I've tried over the years. Dozens and dozens. I fought my body's natural rhythm so long that I developed other chronic health conditions as a result. Sleep is a fundamental block for health, and when you fight against it, your body pays the price.   
I finally found a doctor who is very knowable about DSPD. He looked at my list and said if none of those worked, I was either going to have to accept my body's natural cycle, or further hurt my health by continuing my attempts to shift backwards . This has been the same answer to DSPDers who have seen top sleep specialists as well.   


People who are flexible in their circadian rhythms, or have one that is middle ground, CAN chose to be a night owl. They can also chose to shift back to being a daywalker. For people with DSPD, it is NOT a choice. These people spend years fighting their natural schedules, and get more and more sick until they reach a breaking point. They eventually come to the realization (with the science that backs it) that they have to accept their natural schedule, or continue to become more and more ill. It's awful and hard, but that is the way it is. But they CAN'T change it. "

"8724",188,"shamrocky12",41,7,187,12,0,"The above methods do not work for someone with DPSD. The body has a different circadian rythym than ""normal"" people. That would be like asking people with a ""normal""  sleep schedule to train their body to get tired at 4pm every day. It isn't going to happen no matter what  they do because it goes against their bodies natural order. There have been numerous studies done on this. There is a Harvard sleep medicine department dedicated specifically to studying people with DPSD.
"
"8725",604,"MacNulty",41,15,188,1,0,"Interesting. I think I suffer from dpsd as well (no official diagnosis) and these things help. However it only takes one weekend late party and my schedule goes back tohell. "
"8726",605,"shamrocky12",41,15,604,5,0,"Yeah that's the problem. You can do things, like you mentioned, to help force the issue, however, the body always returns back to it's natural state. I fought that losing battle for decades before finally realizing no amount of habit forming, discipline, drugs etc. would ever change my natural circadian rythym. All I was doing was deluding myself into thinking I could win a losing battle. "
"8727",606,"MacNulty",41,15,605,4,0,"Yeah, in hindsight I never actually ""fixed"" my problem either, I only have periods when I go to bed early but it kind of requires conscious effort. As soon as I stop paying attention to it I revert back to ""normal"".

Embracing it and reorganising my life will probably save me tons of energy."
"8728",607,"shamrocky12",41,15,606,5,0,"If you can, I highly recommend doing so. If you have DPSD, even if/when you manage to get 7-8 hours of sleep, you're brain will still not be functioning at it's normal capacity during early morning hours. You just end up lopping off more productive hours at the end of your day that you could otherwise be enjoying."
"8729",608,"MacNulty",41,15,607,2,0,"Yeah, the only problem is the social aspect. DPSD leaves me with the feeling that I am out of alignment with my surroundings.... as if I was always coming late to the party, and staying at it longer than everyone else. I may be more ""efficient"" this way but also a bit depressed that I can't fit in whereas if I fix my schedule I feel like I fit in but can't work at 100% capacity, feel sluggish and inferior to others.

"8734",48,"MySilverWhining",41,3,1,21,0,"Night owl....  When I worked from home with flexible hours, I had a pretty normal schedule.  I would get up, work out, read the paper, work for eight hours (or six, or ten), then relax.  After work I would maybe go shopping, cook dinner, watch a movie.  Totally normal life.  But I was waking up at 9am and starting work at noon, so people couldn't process that as normal.  They'd think I was lazy for not working in the morning and a boring workaholic for working until 8pm.  Someone who woke up at 5am, worked out, and put in an easy 7 hours at their office was disciplined and wholesome.  Some days I would wake up at 9am, work out, and put in a hard kick-ass 10 hours at work, then go on a date.  Was I disciplined?  Wholesome?  Living a great life?  No.  I was self-indulgent for working out at 10am, a no-life weirdo for working until 10pm, and immature for being out past midnight in the middle of the week.  I knew people who had exactly the same schedule as me and worked exactly as hard as me exception their 8-10 hours started at 7am or 8am.  Instead of treating me like someone they had a lot in common with and one significant difference, they treated me like a lower form of life.  They were wholesome, hard-working, self-sacrificing middle class adults, and I was a man-child who refused to grow up.  They resented me for not getting up as early as them and mocked me for working later than them.  In their eyes I was simultaneously lazy and a workaholic.  I was feeling great so I really didn't realize it until recently.

Now I work a job with regular hours, and I really miss my old schedule.  I pretty much only exercise on weekends.  I don't work as hard, because my sleep isn't as good.  My wife and I can barely compromise on having dinner at 7pm (insanely late for her, feels like a weird intrusion into my day for me.)  And of course by 7pm a good citizen is supposed to have already done everything that is important to them (exercise, work, reading) so it's impossible to communicate to my wife that anything I try to do after that time is something I value.  It's just, if it's important to you, why don't you do it earlier?  If exercise is important, why don't you wake up at 5am and do it?  If you like to read, why don't you read for an hour before work?  If you want to study a language, why don't you do it at 6am on the days when you're not working out?  It's a great excuse for my wife to give zero respect or accommodation to anything I try to do after work.  I'm bored and gaining weight and my friends who get up at 5am are basically like ""Welcome to the real world, you suck because you don't get up at 5am and it's about time it started catching up to you.""

"8829",235,"snoboreddotcom",41,7,1,2,0,"I understand what they are getting at but its not something that can necessarily work for many industries.

Take construction. Work has to be done during daylight hours and times when most people arent sleeping. As a result of this most of the office workers in construction companies need to work 9-5 because issues that come up need to be dealt with promptly, and often involve a lot of coordination between eh various contractors. If you have some people working nights, some day etc coordination in a prompt matter becomes a issue. Jobs and industries which need a lot of local coordination can't really afford to adjust to night-owls because it would be difficult to have things done promptly.

Conversely industries like finance may benefit more from this approach, especially if there are offices coordinating across different time zones. Or industries where work needs to be done at night. Take programmers for computer systems that are always online (like the software running credit card payment machines and processing said payments). Implementations need to be done at night, and their is less need for immediate coordination outside of these times. Being a night-owl may be more valuable in these industries as you can work consistent hours that work with needs that fit both you and the industry.

In summary: Allowing more flexible hours can work in some industries, but not in others. Adapting to allow flexibility can't necessarily happen across all industries. Those where it can should, and those who find themselves to be night owls should, if possible, consider whether their intended career path can allow said flexibility. If someone wants to work more nightly hours and is in school think about where you might be able to work that would fit this."

Depends on your definition of lifestyle. Basically are you saying being a night owl is a choice, or if it isn't then at least it is not debilitating enough for the vast majority of night owls to need any accommodation?

Because certainly you would agree that if it was much more debilitating on average, then some change, i.e. accommodation would be needed? (e.g. like is done for people with physical disabilities?)
