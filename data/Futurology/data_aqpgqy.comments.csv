I think a lot of people confuse actual sentient intelligence to the AI we have today. The AI we have today is just code fueled by thousands of algorithms that are fed lots and lots of data. Nothing 'sentient' about it. 

In order to reach real sentient intelligence we need breakthroughs in Neuroscience more than we need software and hardware updates. Sure the technology we have is getting faster and better but that dosent mean it's getting close to actually becoming self-aware. "

When I was a kid, I figured computers could be programmed to play chess, but 95% of the time the average human would beat the computer player. I was amazed when computers improved to the point where they were consistently beating ""average humans"" and were only outclassed by GrandMasters. Then computers started beating *everyone*.

I always thought the concept of identity to be somewhat of a mirage. Who is not to say every time you fall asleep you effectively die and the next morning someone else wakes up who inherits your memories, personality and everything else that constituted to you as a human being. I'm not saying that is what's happening, but if it hypothetically was, you'd be none the wiser and still be absolutely convinced your life has always been and always will be your own.

I think identity might be a very fluid and passing thing. You're only yourself in passing thought and the rest is just memories really. In that sense the person you were 5 minutes ago isn't even really you anymore either.

So no I agree if you make an exact copy of yourself that person wouldn't be you. But I'm not sure either if it'd be that much more different from your current self, than let's say you in your original body a few hours in the future.

It's just a thought experiment. I'll still pass on stepping into a teleport/copying machine until we understand things like sentience and identity better, but letting go of the concept that personal identity is absolute, immutable and unique seems to solve some of the paradoxes around it."

I always thought the concept of identity to be somewhat of a mirage. Who is not to say every time you fall asleep you effectively die and the next morning someone else wakes up who inherits your memories, personality and everything else that constituted to you as a human being. I'm not saying that is what's happening, but if it hypothetically was, you'd be none the wiser and still be absolutely convinced your life has always been and always will be your own.

I think identity might be a very fluid and passing thing. You're only yourself in passing thought and the rest is just memories really. In that sense the person you were 5 minutes ago isn't even really you anymore either.

So no I agree if you make an exact copy of yourself that person wouldn't be you. But I'm not sure either if it'd be that much more different from your current self, than let's say you in your original body a few hours in the future.

It's just a thought experiment. I'll still pass on stepping into a teleport/copying machine until we understand things like sentience and identity better, but letting go of the concept that personal identity is absolute, immutable and unique seems to solve some of the paradoxes around it."

I think identity might be a very fluid and passing thing. You're only yourself in passing thought and the rest is just memories really. In that sense the person you were 5 minutes ago isn't even really you anymore either.

So no I agree if you make an exact copy of yourself that person wouldn't be you. But I'm not sure either if it'd be that much more different from your current self, than let's say you in your original body a few hours in the future.

The 2080 scenario will see a lot of copies of the original, but the originals will still experience a very real, and final, death, despite the copy continuing.

I always thought the concept of identity to be somewhat of a mirage. Who is not to say every time you fall asleep you effectively die and the next morning someone else wakes up who inherits your memories, personality and everything else that constituted to you as a human being. I'm not saying that is what's happening, but if it hypothetically was, you'd be none the wiser and still be absolutely convinced your life has always been and always will be your own.

I think identity might be a very fluid and passing thing. You're only yourself in passing thought and the rest is just memories really. In that sense the person you were 5 minutes ago isn't even really you anymore either.

So no I agree if you make an exact copy of yourself that person wouldn't be you. But I'm not sure either if it'd be that much more different from your current self, than let's say you in your original body a few hours in the future.

It's just a thought experiment. I'll still pass on stepping into a teleport/copying machine until we understand things like sentience and identity better, but letting go of the concept that personal identity is absolute, immutable and unique seems to solve some of the paradoxes around it."

I always thought the concept of identity to be somewhat of a mirage.

I'm not saying that is what's happening, but if it hypothetically was, you'd be none the wiser and still be absolutely convinced your life has always been and always will be your own.

I think identity might be a very fluid and passing thing. You're only yourself in passing thought and the rest is just memories really. In that sense the person you were 5 minutes ago isn't even really you anymore either.

So no I agree if you make an exact copy of yourself that person wouldn't be you. But I'm not sure either if it'd be that much more different from your current self, than let's say you in your original body a few hours in the future.

When I was a kid, I figured computers could be programmed to play chess, but 95% of the time the average human would beat the computer player. I was amazed when computers improved to the point where they were consistently beating ""average humans"" and were only outclassed by GrandMasters. Then computers started beating *everyone*.

About 5 years ago, I amended my guess to 2045 (which is what Kurzweil and others have estimated it at for about a quarter century now)

Late last year, I changed my guess to 2035

Things are just getting better and better

When I was a kid, I figured computers could be programmed to play chess, but 95% of the time the average human would beat the computer player. I was amazed when computers improved to the point where they were consistently beating ""average humans"" and were only outclassed by GrandMasters. Then computers started beating *everyone*. ""But they'll never be able to handle a more complex game like GO"". But then they got so much better so much faster. I'm becoming a believer that they can achieve more than I ever thought.

I always thought the concept of identity to be somewhat of a mirage. Who is not to say every time you fall asleep you effectively die and the next morning someone else wakes up who inherits your memories, personality and everything else that constituted to you as a human being. I'm not saying that is what's happening, but if it hypothetically was, you'd be none the wiser and still be absolutely convinced your life has always been and always will be your own.

I think identity might be a very fluid and passing thing. You're only yourself in passing thought and the rest is just memories really. In that sense the person you were 5 minutes ago isn't even really you anymore either.

So no I agree if you make an exact copy of yourself that person wouldn't be you. But I'm not sure either if it'd be that much more different from your current self, than let's say you in your original body a few hours in the future.

It's just a thought experiment. I'll still pass on stepping into a teleport/copying machine until we understand things like sentience and identity better, but letting go of the concept that personal identity is absolute, immutable and unique seems to solve some of the paradoxes around it."
"897",79,"DelosBoard2052",24,18,78,1,0,"It's really not about identity, it's about the experiencer of the experience.  The one thing you cannot deny in all the universe, the one true thing you can state with certainty, is that you are experiencing something.

I think a lot of people confuse actual sentient intelligence to the AI we have today. The AI we have today is just code fueled by thousands of algorithms that are fed lots and lots of data. Nothing 'sentient' about it. 

In order to reach real sentient intelligence we need breakthroughs in Neuroscience more than we need software and hardware updates. Sure the technology we have is getting faster and better but that dosent mean it's getting close to actually becoming self-aware. "

I'm fine with narrow AI taking over every facet of our lives, but an AI that can think for itself, that seems frightening considering it would be vastly more intelligent than us. People say they would program it to only obey our commands or we'd ""pull the plug"" but wouldn't it see that coming? Wouldn't it account for that and then wait for the right moment to strike rather than attacking right off the get go? As far as my guess goes, I'd wager that kurzweil isn't far off the mark. "

Just kidding. It's probably going to take a few hundred years since singularity is something entirely different from ""deep fakes"" and Go-playing ""AIs""."
"918",62,"CaptainBearman",24,9,1,-3,0,"Probably never. Climate change will end our civilization before we get to that point. "

The Real Singularity, where a live human will be able to literally shift their full actual conscious being into a new hosting structure, free of their original biological support structure: 2480.

The 2080 scenario will see a lot of copies of the original, but the originals will still experience a very real, and final, death, despite the copy continuing.

Since people still don't actually know with certainty what consciousness even is......  how can they propose to contain it?

Long way to go.
"
"921",92,"Beepboopbop8",24,21,91,2,0,"that is where I disagree. it isnt about passing the Turing Test, its about matching our intelligence. if AI can surpass our intellect, not our consciousness, it can exponentially improve itself until it does become consciousor so one could assume. its honestly a toss-up with what happens after it hits"
"922",93,"StarlightDown",24,23,92,2,0,"On the other hand, it's also possible that the 2080 AI will see true consciousness as useless, and not waste its resources trying to achieve it.

A lot of what humans dofrom working at a cash register to designing industrial equipmentprobably doesn't need human consciousness. We're already replacing cashiers with kiosks, and using AI to build complex computer models, even though we're nowhere near giving robots a consciousness.

I think identity might be a very fluid and passing thing. You're only yourself in passing thought and the rest is just memories really. In that sense the person you were 5 minutes ago isn't even really you anymore either.

So no I agree if you make an exact copy of yourself that person wouldn't be you. But I'm not sure either if it'd be that much more different from your current self, than let's say you in your original body a few hours in the future.

I always thought the concept of identity to be somewhat of a mirage.

I'm not saying that is what's happening, but if it hypothetically was, you'd be none the wiser and still be absolutely convinced your life has always been and always will be your own.

I think identity might be a very fluid and passing thing. You're only yourself in passing thought and the rest is just memories really. In that sense the person you were 5 minutes ago isn't even really you anymore either.

So no I agree if you make an exact copy of yourself that person wouldn't be you. But I'm not sure either if it'd be that much more different from your current self, than let's say you in your original body a few hours in the future.

It's just a thought experiment. I'll still pass on stepping into a teleport/copying machine until we understand things like sentience and identity better, but letting go of the concept that personal identity is absolute, immutable and unique seems to solve some of the paradoxes around it."

I always thought the concept of identity to be somewhat of a mirage.

I'm not saying that is what's happening, but if it hypothetically was, you'd be none the wiser and still be absolutely convinced your life has always been and always will be your own.

I think identity might be a very fluid and passing thing. You're only yourself in passing thought and the rest is just memories really. In that sense the person you were 5 minutes ago isn't even really you anymore either.

So no I agree if you make an exact copy of yourself that person wouldn't be you. But I'm not sure either if it'd be that much more different from your current self, than let's say you in your original body a few hours in the future.

When I was a kid, I figured computers could be programmed to play chess, but 95% of the time the average human would beat the computer player. I was amazed when computers improved to the point where they were consistently beating ""average humans"" and were only outclassed by GrandMasters. Then computers started beating *everyone*.

"1228",93,"StarlightDown",30,23,92,2,0,"On the other hand, it's also possible that the 2080 AI will see true consciousness as useless, and not waste its resources trying to achieve it.

A lot of what humans dofrom working at a cash register to designing industrial equipmentprobably doesn't need human consciousness. We're already replacing cashiers with kiosks, and using AI to build complex computer models, even though we're nowhere near giving robots a consciousness. The super-AI in the future might decide it's more economical to keep doing this, instead of trying to solve the hard problem of the mind."
