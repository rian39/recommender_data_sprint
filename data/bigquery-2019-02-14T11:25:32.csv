"It took a lot of work to get this done.  Submission objects are a lot more complex than comment objects and I needed to design the script in such a way that new fields would get automatically included in the database without breaking the script.  Essentially, all of the major fields for submission objects are available.  The media fields which are heavily nested are a JSON object under the column ""json_extended""  If new fields are added to the API, those fields will also automatically get included in the JSON object as values to the json_extended key/column. 

All ids for subreddits, link_ids, comment ids and submission ids have been converted to base 10 integers.  You can still match up comments to submissions between the two tables using the link_id value in comments which will link to the id key in the submission table.  I have also preserved the base36 submission id under the ""name"" column in the submission table.

This script will run constantly and feed both tables in near real-time -- with objects usually ending up there within 1-3 seconds of getting posted to Reddit (barring any issues with the Reddit API getting overwhelmed at times).

Both tables are partitioned using the created_utc column, which is type ""timestamp.""  This will allow you to do searches for date ranges and only hit the partitioned tables necessary to complete the query (saving you data processing bytes -- remember, you get one terabyte free per month).

I will be following up in this post with some SQL examples and eventually share some interesting queries that you can use by logging into the BigQuery web console.

You can also use both of these tables within Python and other popular programming languages.  As soon as I get some time, I will also post some code samples on how to run queries against the data using Python.

Please let me know if you have any questions related to the tables or the data.

Happy big data hunting!",28,2018-05-23 21:55:41,8ljjmo,31,Reddit Submissions are now being streamed to BigQuery live along with comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigquery/comments/8ljjmo/reddit_submissions_are_now_being_streamed_to/

"I may be reading the documentation incorrectly, but I am trying to test partitions on a table for real-time Reddit comments.  This is the SQL I am using (Standard SQL since that is what is supported by partitioned tables)

    SELECT subreddit FROM `pushshift.rt_reddit.comments` WHERE _PARTITIONDATE >= ""2018-01-29""

I am getting the error:

""Error: Unrecognized name: _PARTITIONDATE at [1:60]""

Should I be using the actual field name I used as the partition (created_utc)?  Will it know to only scan the partitions needed to fulfill a where request even if the times overlap days?

   (i.e. _PARTITIONTIME >= ""2018-01-29 09:30:00"" AND _PARTITIONTIME < ""2018-01-30 02:15:00""

    SELECT subreddit from `pushshift.rt_reddit.comments` WHERE created_utc > TIMESTAMP(DATETIME_SUB(CURRENT_DATETIME(), INTERVAL 3 DAY))

This will show the last 3 days, so I'm assuming it would know to use just 4 partitions if the partitions are by day?",2,2018-05-18 07:33:15,8k8rud,5,Using _PARTITIONDATE pseudo column,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigquery/comments/8k8rud/using_partitiondate_pseudo_column/

"Major beginner to SQL and BigQuery. Currently, I am just trying to get data points for all of the historical data on /u/Stuck_In_the_Matrix's data set. Specifically trying to count the number of appearances of a specific phrase on one subreddit, and how this number varies over time. Any help would be super appreciated!",3,2018-05-15 10:18:27,8ji0kb,4,[Beginner] How to use BigQuery to identify the number of times a phrase appears on a specific subreddit over time,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigquery/comments/8ji0kb/beginner_how_to_use_bigquery_to_identify_the/

I was recently looking through the Reddit comment data and realized it hasn't been updated since December 2017. Any chance data from 2018 will be added to the set? I'd love to use it for a project I'm working on.,2,2018-04-13 06:19:42,8bu849,6,Reddit Data post-2017?,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigquery/comments/8bu849/reddit_data_post2017/
