**EDIT:** Maybe they do. Some moderator attacked me for 'spreading misinformation', I think for this post. Yet this is what I heard from one of the moderators (to be precise, that meta threads about the rules are banned for reasons of Rule 8, not because of the existence of a megathread, which a new announcement would not negate). Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

(They linked images of other subs linking here, but not brigading subs linking here. As in, JordanPeterson sub cross linked here. That's not brigading and has nothing to do with self posts.)


So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

"141",141,"saint2e",1,1,1,11,0,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."

I can very well believe that overall the quality will be better, but at this point the rule change doesn't matter one bit, the fact that the mods didn't respect the community and after that even laughed at the community does.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"148",148,"ClockworkFool",1,1,147,8,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

Was in the modmail, at least the admission. I heard something like: ""I wanted to take action for D&amp;C but after consulting with other mods couldn't."" I don't want to name people, because that might put a target on them.

Then why did they feel the need to repeatedly change their stated motivation for doing so and to insult members of the community who spoke out against it? I get that you're desperate to defend the mods now, but you're really not thinking this through, so your bullshit is easy to see through. 

Here's a question for you though: *why* are you so desperate to defend them? You're extremely bad at it, only managing to parade your bias for everyone to see, yet you double down and continue to push the same argument that has now been called out as ignoring crucial facts of the matter *twice*. Is it empathy? Do you feel empathy for the mods' power tripping and feel hurt by the attacks on them? You're not even a mod. You have no power to trip on."

"164",164,"etiolatezed",1,1,141,11,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"165",165,"saint2e",1,1,164,4,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"166",166,"etiolatezed",1,1,165,7,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"167",167,"peenoid",1,1,164,0,0,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"168",168,"tekende",1,1,167,1,0,"A grocery store shelf is a finite space. Reddit is not.

It's not hot sauce *instead of* Cocoa Puffs, it's hot sauce *and* Cocoa Puffs."
"169",169,"etiolatezed",1,1,167,1,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"170",170,"peenoid",1,1,169,0,0,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"171",171,"etiolatezed",1,1,170,0,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading. 

Know the difference between an explanation and an excuse. "

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions. "

This prompts the question: is there ""better"" content that was being suppressed by the stuff you aren't interested in, or will the self-post change ultimately result in _less_ content overall (and you're just noticing more of the stuff you like although the total volume of it has remained the same)?

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Why are they shit, you ask? Im no gambler, but if i had to bet id say its because they contain a vile mixture of: pride, narcissism, general assholery, lust for power, self importance, and, most importantly, mental health problems.  We all mocked poor david for his autism, little did we know our mods are more mentally fucked than him.

Modding attracts a certain type of person. Someone who has a lot of free time to do shit for free. Basically someone who has a minimal social life, and thats an immediate red flag right there. All this hassle and they dont even get payed!!! Theyre emotionally invested in this internet forum in which everyone hates em but for the non existent silent majority. That shows me their lives are meaningless. 

Face it kia, most of our mods have some form of mental health problem. Bipolar disorder,  depression,  autism, anxiety,  etc. Abort ship or be ruled by idiots.

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"374",281,"etiolatezed",2,2,199,15,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways.

"375",282,"saint2e",2,2,281,6,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"376",283,"etiolatezed",2,2,282,9,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"377",284,"peenoid",2,2,281,0,0,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"378",285,"etiolatezed",2,2,284,2,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"379",286,"peenoid",2,2,285,0,0,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"380",287,"etiolatezed",2,2,286,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "
"388",295,"saint2e",2,2,294,2,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from...

"389",296,"ClockworkFool",2,2,295,7,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

If that is the only post, I wouldn't find it objectionable at all. But I think there is more, particularly since there are highly divergent views on what does or doesn't qualify as a given topic.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

(They linked images of other subs linking here, but not brigading subs linking here. As in, JordanPeterson sub cross linked here. That's not brigading and has nothing to do with self posts.)


So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/9tngex/meta_the_moderation_has_become_an_unaccountable/e8xuz9x/


This is what the mods have become. People want them to revert the rule change all step down. There's been other abusive behavior by mods like pinkerbelle, iamsupernova and shadist. Mods like Hessmix who don't do the abuse in the sub instead encourage it in the private discord. "

It wasn't a false accusation. Despite what the mod of that sub says, go look at the public modlog for that sub.  The top item in it right now is a post removal that was calling for KiA2 users to come here and disrupt the sub.

4-month old post where not only was I not shitposting, I was legitimately confused about what the person accusing Hessmix of lying was talking about. did you read the entire context or just find a single meme-reply and decide that somehow equates ""abusive behavior""?

Memes are ""abusive""?

EDIT: OH!! LOL!  That was you!

You never did explain how Hessmix was lying about a post while at the same time claiming he never clicked it, making it impossible for him to lie about something he hadn't even read."

It was. I post at kia2. I saw the KF thread and the mod specifically said not to link to KF. There is no brigading going on at kia2.

""I'm not shitposting. I'm not lying.""

Let me add: I'm not accountable.

That's the deal. I find it hilarious you want me to show you things that have been deleted. Do the users need to start archiving all the mod posts? Is it that bad?  I show you two examples of bad behavior. I show you lying about brigading. You deny it despite people being able to find the truth themselves.

Posting a single meme pic of confused black guy when you're making absurd claims that a mod is lying about what's in a link when you say he didn't even click it, but his ""lies"" about the link 100% fit what's inside the link.  How is that even possible?

We all mocked poor david for his autism, little did we know our mods are more mentally fucked than him.

Modding attracts a certain type of person. Someone who has a lot of free time to do shit for free. Basically someone who has a minimal social life, and thats an immediate red flag right there. All this hassle and they dont even get payed!!! Theyre emotionally invested in this internet forum in which everyone hates em but for the non existent silent majority.

"615",200,"saint2e",3,1,1,12,0,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"616",356,"etiolatezed",3,3,200,12,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"617",357,"saint2e",3,3,356,7,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"618",358,"etiolatezed",3,3,357,10,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"619",359,"peenoid",3,3,356,0,0,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"620",360,"etiolatezed",3,3,359,2,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"621",361,"peenoid",3,3,360,0,0,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"622",362,"etiolatezed",3,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"631",371,"ClockworkFool",3,3,370,8,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

Except, it's neither particularly beneficial, nor is it the reason they did it - or they would have said so.

This prompts the question: is there ""better"" content that was being suppressed by the stuff you aren't interested in, or will the self-post change ultimately result in _less_ content overall (and you're just noticing more of the stuff you like although the total volume of it has remained the same)?

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Can you give some specific examples of the stuff you were seeing before vs what's here now? Because as a daily visitor I'm honestly not seeing much of a difference."

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.  Even in the main meta thread, it was stated by a couple mods the sub still sees 30k unique *daily* visitors, and before I stepped down, that was fairly consistent (somewhere around 300-350k uniques per month, IIRC).  The traffic page was hidden from public view by the admins, not the mods, and it doesn't take much effort to ask the mods what current traffic looks like - some mods actually like sharing that info."

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

&gt; I mean look at this reply... so far you've dismissed it because of a false positive and then ""showing brigades isn't proof enough, you must now show links to things that would be removed"" as if I wasn't just trying to show proof of brigades.

I never doubted that there were brigades. However, since your position is that (1) they are a problem, an urgent one and that they (2) will be mostly solved with this change, just showing brigades is not sufficient. For all people know, all these brigades are of posts that would pass under the new rules, so what have you proven then?

"860",201,"saint2e",4,1,1,13,0,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"861",202,"etiolatezed",4,1,201,12,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"862",439,"saint2e",4,4,202,2,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"863",440,"etiolatezed",4,4,439,9,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"864",441,"peenoid",4,4,202,-1,0,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"865",442,"etiolatezed",4,4,441,2,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"866",443,"peenoid",4,4,442,-1,0,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"867",444,"etiolatezed",4,4,443,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"876",453,"ClockworkFool",4,4,452,5,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

"877",454,"saint2e",4,4,453,2,0,"In looking at AoV's submissions for the past month or so I can definitely see a few of those submissions not making the cut.  Personally speaking, the one about IMC I would've scrolled right by without clicking, that one probably wouldn't have made it, and perhaps rightly so in my estimation.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

The bulk of them all centre around Journalistic Ethics IMHO, and thus would've been fine, I would've thought."

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

If that is the only post, I wouldn't find it objectionable at all. But I think there is more, particularly since there are highly divergent views on what does or doesn't qualify as a given topic.

Still, it's all peanuts compared to the way it was done. "
"879",456,"target_locked",4,4,453,-5,0,"&gt;  and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned. 

Which one?  I don't recall this particular venture, though AoV has a laundry list of rule violating here, we've actually gone above and beyond to keep him around.  Of course things have obviously changed within the last few days and the mods aren't going to work too hard to keep him around anymore.  

It's still on him whether he can follow the rules or not though.  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago."
"880",457,"ClockworkFool",4,4,456,7,0,"&gt;Which one?

"881",458,"AntonioOfVenice",4,4,456,3,0,"&gt; Which one? I don't recall this particular venture

Was in the modmail, at least the admission. I heard something like: ""I wanted to take action for D&amp;C but after consulting with other mods couldn't."" I don't want to name people, because that might put a target on them.

&gt;  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago.

Then why did they feel the need to repeatedly change their stated motivation for doing so and to insult members of the community who spoke out against it? I get that you're desperate to defend the mods now, but you're really not thinking this through, so your bullshit is easy to see through. 

Here's a question for you though: *why* are you so desperate to defend them? You're extremely bad at it, only managing to parade your bias for everyone to see, yet you double down and continue to push the same argument that has now been called out as ignoring crucial facts of the matter *twice*. Is it empathy? Do you feel empathy for the mods' power tripping and feel hurt by the attacks on them? You're not even a mod. You have no power to trip on."

"892",469,"ClockworkFool",4,4,201,8,0,"&gt;But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

You realized that so you deleted your comment while i think your bfs protected you in the comments.

Modding attracts a certain type of person. Someone who has a lot of free time to do shit for free. Basically someone who has a minimal social life, and thats an immediate red flag right there. All this hassle and they dont even get payed!!! Theyre emotionally invested in this internet forum in which everyone hates em but for the non existent silent majority.

"1120",200,"saint2e",5,1,1,9,0,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"1121",356,"etiolatezed",5,3,200,16,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"1122",357,"saint2e",5,3,356,5,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"1123",358,"etiolatezed",5,3,357,10,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"1124",359,"peenoid",5,3,356,-1,0,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"1125",360,"etiolatezed",5,3,359,2,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"1126",361,"peenoid",5,3,360,-1,0,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"1127",362,"etiolatezed",5,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "
"1135",370,"saint2e",5,3,369,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from...

"1136",371,"ClockworkFool",5,3,370,9,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire.

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

It's been nice.  That's all I'm saying."
"1176",411,"peenoid",5,3,200,2,0,"&gt; Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult. I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

This prompts the question: is there ""better"" content that was being suppressed by the stuff you aren't interested in, or will the self-post change ultimately result in _less_ content overall (and you're just noticing more of the stuff you like although the total volume of it has remained the same)?

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Can you give some specific examples of the stuff you were seeing before vs what's here now? Because as a daily visitor I'm honestly not seeing much of a difference."
"1177",412,"saint2e",5,3,411,2,0,"Yeah time will tell on the ""better content"" or if it's just a coincedence.

And as I said, there's still some stuff on the front page that I ""eye roll and scroll on"", but there seems to be less overall.

A subreddit should be a reflection of what the subscribers desire. If the subscribers desire it to evolve, it should (within the site-wide rules). If they desire it to remain the same, it should.

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.  Even in the main meta thread, it was stated by a couple mods the sub still sees 30k unique *daily* visitors, and before I stepped down, that was fairly consistent (somewhere around 300-350k uniques per month, IIRC).  The traffic page was hidden from public view by the admins, not the mods, and it doesn't take much effort to ask the mods what current traffic looks like - some mods actually like sharing that info."

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

**EDIT:** Maybe they do. Some moderator attacked me for 'spreading misinformation', I think for this post. Yet this is what I heard from one of the moderators (to be precise, that meta threads about the rules are banned for reasons of Rule 8, not because of the existence of a megathread, which a new announcement would not negate). Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

If meta threads regarding the rule change are no longer banned, good on them and credit where credit is due. "

That said, I'm happy with how the new rule changes came out in the end and I think most of the sub realizes it's an improvement. If people want to start a different sub with different rules that's fine with me as well, just be aware the realities of reddit will eventually kick in. This place isn't ideal for a lot of what we want and there isn't anything we can do about that until it gets a quality competitor with enough resources to do so.

And yeah, it's fine for people to start other subreddits of course. It's just a fact that those other subreddits will be ghost towns unless they convince people that *this* subreddit is in shambles so they can poach our members. "

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

"1387",200,"saint2e",6,1,1,12,0,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"1388",356,"etiolatezed",6,3,200,16,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"1389",357,"saint2e",6,3,356,3,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"1390",358,"etiolatezed",6,3,357,12,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"1391",359,"peenoid",6,3,356,-1,0,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"1392",360,"etiolatezed",6,3,359,2,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "

The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"1394",362,"etiolatezed",6,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I can very well believe that overall the quality will be better, but at this point the rule change doesn't matter one bit, the fact that the mods didn't respect the community and after that even laughed at the community does.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "
"1402",370,"saint2e",6,3,369,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from...

"1403",371,"ClockworkFool",6,3,370,8,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

"1404",372,"saint2e",6,3,371,5,0,"In looking at AoV's submissions for the past month or so I can definitely see a few of those submissions not making the cut.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

The bulk of them all centre around Journalistic Ethics IMHO, and thus would've been fine, I would've thought."

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

If that is the only post, I wouldn't find it objectionable at all. But I think there is more, particularly since there are highly divergent views on what does or doesn't qualify as a given topic.

Which one?  I don't recall this particular venture, though AoV has a laundry list of rule violating here, we've actually gone above and beyond to keep him around.  Of course things have obviously changed within the last few days and the mods aren't going to work too hard to keep him around anymore.  

It's still on him whether he can follow the rules or not though.  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago."

You're extremely bad at it, only managing to parade your bias for everyone to see, yet you double down and continue to push the same argument that has now been called out as ignoring crucial facts of the matter *twice*.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

A subreddit should be a reflection of what the subscribers desire. If the subscribers desire it to evolve, it should (within the site-wide rules). If they desire it to remain the same, it should.

The moderators have decided that they know best, and they should rule on the direction of the sub, even going so far as to hold and ignore the results of votes held to supposedly make decisions."

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.  Even in the main meta thread, it was stated by a couple mods the sub still sees 30k unique *daily* visitors, and before I stepped down, that was fairly consistent (somewhere around 300-350k uniques per month, IIRC).  The traffic page was hidden from public view by the admins, not the mods, and it doesn't take much effort to ask the mods what current traffic looks like - some mods actually like sharing that info."

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

**EDIT:** Maybe they do. Some moderator attacked me for 'spreading misinformation', I think for this post. Yet this is what I heard from one of the moderators (to be precise, that meta threads about the rules are banned for reasons of Rule 8, not because of the existence of a megathread, which a new announcement would not negate). Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

If meta threads regarding the rule change are no longer banned, good on them and credit where credit is due. "

His position has consistently been whatever will give him power and attention.  Meanwhile, everything here is actually fine.

That said, I'm happy with how the new rule changes came out in the end and I think most of the sub realizes it's an improvement. If people want to start a different sub with different rules that's fine with me as well, just be aware the realities of reddit will eventually kick in. This place isn't ideal for a lot of what we want and there isn't anything we can do about that until it gets a quality competitor with enough resources to do so. Partly that's why we still link to GGHQ on 8chan, and I'm looking into other alternative places for GG'ers to discuss things that won't be constricted by reddits rules or it's obnoxious primary user base of rabid progressives."

I think the mods should have leaned on KIAChatroom, maybe promoted it in a sticky or made it more obvious in some other way as the place for off topic shit/lightly moderated banter. 

And yeah, it's fine for people to start other subreddits of course. It's just a fact that those other subreddits will be ghost towns unless they convince people that *this* subreddit is in shambles so they can poach our members. "
"1494",513,"Notalent13",7,5,11,4,0,"I mean I post on KIAchatroom, but that place IS a ghost town, and any attempt to convince people to post shit there and not here has always been taken as incredibly divisive before, basically the equivalent to telling them to ""go elsewhere"".

I find it funny that you guys place this complete and total faith in upvotes/downvotes.   

Why do you think almost every single larger sub on reddit has rules (that are FAARR more restrictive than ours) about keeping things topical?   It's because people upvote shit.

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

"1656",200,"saint2e",7,1,1,11,0,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"1657",356,"etiolatezed",7,3,200,15,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"1658",357,"saint2e",7,3,356,5,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"1659",358,"etiolatezed",7,3,357,12,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"1660",359,"peenoid",7,3,356,-1,0,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"1661",360,"etiolatezed",7,3,359,2,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"1662",361,"peenoid",7,3,360,-1,0,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"1663",362,"etiolatezed",7,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"1671",370,"saint2e",7,3,369,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from...

"1672",371,"ClockworkFool",7,3,370,6,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

"1681",380,"saint2e",7,3,379,2,0,"Or perhaps the mods were taking the admittedly bold strategy of doing what they felt would be right in the long run, even if it went against the grain of the subreddit.  

We'll see if it pays off."
"1682",381,"Carkudo",7,3,380,2,0,"&gt; Or perhaps the mods were taking the admittedly bold strategy of doing what they felt would be right

Then why did they feel the need to repeatedly change their stated motivation for doing so and to insult members of the community who spoke out against it? I get that you're desperate to defend the mods now, but you're really not thinking this through, so your bullshit is easy to see through. 

Here's a question for you though: *why* are you so desperate to defend them? You're extremely bad at it, only managing to parade your bias for everyone to see, yet you double down and continue to push the same argument that has now been called out as ignoring crucial facts of the matter *twice*. Is it empathy? Do you feel empathy for the mods' power tripping and feel hurt by the attacks on them? You're not even a mod. You have no power to trip on."

"1688",387,"ClockworkFool",7,3,200,8,0,"&gt;But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions. "
"1689",388,"saint2e",7,3,387,7,0,"And that's basically my disclaimer at the end with the sample size.  ""So far, not so bad"" is essentially my point.  But we'll see if that continues."

"1691",390,"saint2e",7,3,389,2,0,"Yup.  It'd be nice to get away from the YouTuber drama and other tangents, and if that persists, I'd be okay with that."
"1692",391,"Carkudo",7,3,200,9,0,"Except, the reasoning you're providing now is not the same as the reasoning provided by the mods. Not the same as any of them, as they themselves can't seem to settle on any particular reason why they even needed to fuck over the community in the first place, which is a strong indicator that they did so for shit and giggles. That you can rationalize why this measure could potentially somehow be beneficial doesn't really change anything other than expose your bias."
"1693",392,"saint2e",7,3,391,3,1,"All I'm saying is that ""so far, not so bad"", and adding a disclaimer that it's only been a week or so."
"1694",393,"Carkudo",7,3,392,7,0,"Exactly. While people are disturbed that the mod team not only ignored the wishes of the community, but did so smugly and then spent two additional days doing nothing but insulting anyone who disagrees, you pipe up with ""Oh hey, but here's why maybe what they did is beneficial, and maybe that's why they did it!"" Except, it's neither particularly beneficial, nor is it the reason they did it - or they would have said so. You're rationalizing something irrational, and the only thing you achieve by doing so is showing everyone that you're biased in favor of the mod team."
"1695",394,"saint2e",7,3,393,0,1,"Well see if it was the right call in the long run I suppose."
"1696",568,"Carkudo",7,5,394,6,0,"Yes, you've already said that - that's your mantra. First you try to rationalize, then when your bullshit is called out you blank out and start repeating a mantra.  That's the kind of person you are."
"1697",569,"saint2e",7,5,568,2,0,"It's my opinion and I'm sticking to it!"
"1698",570,"Carkudo",7,5,569,5,0,"""We'll see"" is not an opinion, dumbass."

"1711",410,"saint2e",7,3,409,6,0,"I don't usually downvote anything.  I just scroll past.  Lately I've had to do less scrolling (once all the meta posts disappeared, save for this one).

This prompts the question: is there ""better"" content that was being suppressed by the stuff you aren't interested in, or will the self-post change ultimately result in _less_ content overall (and you're just noticing more of the stuff you like although the total volume of it has remained the same)?

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Can you give some specific examples of the stuff you were seeing before vs what's here now? Because as a daily visitor I'm honestly not seeing much of a difference."
"1713",412,"saint2e",7,3,411,2,0,"Yeah time will tell on the ""better content"" or if it's just a coincedence.

And as I said, there's still some stuff on the front page that I ""eye roll and scroll on"", but there seems to be less overall.

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

If meta threads regarding the rule change are no longer banned, good on them and credit where credit is due. "

Modding attracts a certain type of person. Someone who has a lot of free time to do shit for free. Basically someone who has a minimal social life, and thats an immediate red flag right there.

"1926",200,"saint2e",8,1,1,8,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"1927",356,"etiolatezed",8,3,200,16,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"1928",357,"saint2e",8,3,356,5,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"1929",358,"etiolatezed",8,3,357,14,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"1930",359,"peenoid",8,3,356,-1,0,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"1931",360,"etiolatezed",8,3,359,2,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"1932",361,"peenoid",8,3,360,-1,0,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"1933",362,"etiolatezed",8,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"1942",371,"ClockworkFool",8,3,370,8,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire.

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

This prompts the question: is there ""better"" content that was being suppressed by the stuff you aren't interested in, or will the self-post change ultimately result in _less_ content overall (and you're just noticing more of the stuff you like although the total volume of it has remained the same)?

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Can you give some specific examples of the stuff you were seeing before vs what's here now? Because as a daily visitor I'm honestly not seeing much of a difference."

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.  Even in the main meta thread, it was stated by a couple mods the sub still sees 30k unique *daily* visitors, and before I stepped down, that was fairly consistent (somewhere around 300-350k uniques per month, IIRC).  The traffic page was hidden from public view by the admins, not the mods, and it doesn't take much effort to ask the mods what current traffic looks like - some mods actually like sharing that info."

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

Yet this is what I heard from one of the moderators (to be precise, that meta threads about the rules are banned for reasons of Rule 8, not because of the existence of a megathread, which a new announcement would not negate). Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

That said, I'm happy with how the new rule changes came out in the end and I think most of the sub realizes it's an improvement. If people want to start a different sub with different rules that's fine with me as well, just be aware the realities of reddit will eventually kick in. This place isn't ideal for a lot of what we want and there isn't anything we can do about that until it gets a quality competitor with enough resources to do so.

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

"2196",200,"saint2e",9,1,1,11,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"2197",356,"etiolatezed",9,3,200,18,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"2198",357,"saint2e",9,3,356,4,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"2199",358,"etiolatezed",9,3,357,13,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"2200",359,"peenoid",9,3,356,-1,0,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"2201",360,"etiolatezed",9,3,359,2,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"2202",361,"peenoid",9,3,360,-1,0,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"2203",362,"etiolatezed",9,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading. 

Know the difference between an explanation and an excuse. "

I can very well believe that overall the quality will be better, but at this point the rule change doesn't matter one bit, the fact that the mods didn't respect the community and after that even laughed at the community does.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "
"2211",370,"saint2e",9,3,369,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from...

"2212",371,"ClockworkFool",9,3,370,9,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

"2213",372,"saint2e",9,3,371,5,0,"In looking at AoV's submissions for the past month or so I can definitely see a few of those submissions not making the cut.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

If that is the only post, I wouldn't find it objectionable at all. But I think there is more, particularly since there are highly divergent views on what does or doesn't qualify as a given topic.

Of course things have obviously changed within the last few days and the mods aren't going to work too hard to keep him around anymore.  

It's still on him whether he can follow the rules or not though.  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago."

You're extremely bad at it, only managing to parade your bias for everyone to see, yet you double down and continue to push the same argument that has now been called out as ignoring crucial facts of the matter *twice*.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

That said, I'm happy with how the new rule changes came out in the end and I think most of the sub realizes it's an improvement. If people want to start a different sub with different rules that's fine with me as well, just be aware the realities of reddit will eventually kick in. This place isn't ideal for a lot of what we want and there isn't anything we can do about that until it gets a quality competitor with enough resources to do so.

And yeah, it's fine for people to start other subreddits of course. It's just a fact that those other subreddits will be ghost towns unless they convince people that *this* subreddit is in shambles so they can poach our members. "

Sorry, but I don't think we need a vote on that.

I find it funny that you guys place this complete and total faith in upvotes/downvotes.   

Why do you think almost every single larger sub on reddit has rules (that are FAARR more restrictive than ours) about keeping things topical?   It's because people upvote shit.

There's a reasonable argument that they helped win a Presidential election. Many threads end up being about memes like NPC and learntocode.

I realize I'm probably in more of a minority on this than even the mods, but this is something I just fundamentally don't understand. If the goal is to make an impact on a culture war, why kneecap ourselves on a communication tool in widespread use by... uh... culture.

Our goal is just to *talk* about the culture war? And this is a position that's sustainable... indefinitely?"

In moderation?  Nothing.

I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

yes. 

Here's the thing too.  We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down.  We used to have email campaigns and shit. 


I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald?   And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been.  They meme and shitpost hard.   We don't.

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

"2469",200,"saint2e",10,1,1,12,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"2470",356,"etiolatezed",10,3,200,15,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"2471",357,"saint2e",10,3,356,4,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"2472",358,"etiolatezed",10,3,357,14,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"2473",359,"peenoid",10,3,356,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"2474",360,"etiolatezed",10,3,359,1,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"2475",361,"peenoid",10,3,360,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"2476",362,"etiolatezed",10,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"2484",370,"saint2e",10,3,369,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from...

"2485",371,"ClockworkFool",10,3,370,10,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned. "
"2486",372,"saint2e",10,3,371,5,0,"In looking at AoV's submissions for the past month or so I can definitely see a few of those submissions not making the cut.  Personally speaking, the one about IMC I would've scrolled right by without clicking, that one probably wouldn't have made it, and perhaps rightly so in my estimation.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

The bulk of them all centre around Journalistic Ethics IMHO, and thus would've been fine, I would've thought."

Personally speaking, the one about IMC I would've scrolled right by without clicking, that one probably wouldn't have made it, and perhaps rightly so in my estimation.

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

If that is the only post, I wouldn't find it objectionable at all. But I think there is more, particularly since there are highly divergent views on what does or doesn't qualify as a given topic.

Still, it's all peanuts compared to the way it was done. "
"2488",374,"target_locked",10,3,371,-1,0,"&gt;  and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned. 

Which one?  I don't recall this particular venture, though AoV has a laundry list of rule violating here, we've actually gone above and beyond to keep him around.  Of course things have obviously changed within the last few days and the mods aren't going to work too hard to keep him around anymore.  

It's still on him whether he can follow the rules or not though.  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago."
"2489",375,"ClockworkFool",10,3,374,7,0,"&gt;Which one?

Perhaps you should ask Antonio, or the other mods in your discord if you'd like specifics? It's not my place to get involved any more than I already have. "
"2490",376,"AntonioOfVenice",10,3,374,7,0,"&gt; Which one? I don't recall this particular venture

Was in the modmail, at least the admission. I heard something like: ""I wanted to take action for D&amp;C but after consulting with other mods couldn't."" I don't want to name people, because that might put a target on them.

Then why did they feel the need to repeatedly change their stated motivation for doing so and to insult members of the community who spoke out against it? I get that you're desperate to defend the mods now, but you're really not thinking this through, so your bullshit is easy to see through. 

Here's a question for you though: *why* are you so desperate to defend them? You're extremely bad at it, only managing to parade your bias for everyone to see, yet you double down and continue to push the same argument that has now been called out as ignoring crucial facts of the matter *twice*. Is it empathy? Do you feel empathy for the mods' power tripping and feel hurt by the attacks on them? You're not even a mod. You have no power to trip on."

"2501",387,"ClockworkFool",10,3,200,9,0,"&gt;But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions. "

"2505",391,"Carkudo",10,3,200,9,0,"Except, the reasoning you're providing now is not the same as the reasoning provided by the mods. Not the same as any of them, as they themselves can't seem to settle on any particular reason why they even needed to fuck over the community in the first place, which is a strong indicator that they did so for shit and giggles.

While people are disturbed that the mod team not only ignored the wishes of the community, but did so smugly and then spent two additional days doing nothing but insulting anyone who disagrees, you pipe up with ""Oh hey, but here's why maybe what they did is beneficial, and maybe that's why they did it!"" Except, it's neither particularly beneficial, nor is it the reason they did it - or they would have said so. You're rationalizing something irrational, and the only thing you achieve by doing so is showing everyone that you're biased in favor of the mod team."

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

Which is a real screenshot, since it comes from Bane himself: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/9tngex/meta_the_moderation_has_become_an_unaccountable/e8xuz9x/


This is what the mods have become. People want them to revert the rule change all step down. There's been other abusive behavior by mods like pinkerbelle, iamsupernova and shadist. Mods like Hessmix who don't do the abuse in the sub instead encourage it in the private discord. "

It wasn't a false accusation. Despite what the mod of that sub says, go look at the public modlog for that sub.  The top item in it right now is a post removal that was calling for KiA2 users to come here and disrupt the sub.

It was allowed to stay up for 7 hours.

4-month old post where not only was I not shitposting, I was legitimately confused about what the person accusing Hessmix of lying was talking about. did you read the entire context or just find a single meme-reply and decide that somehow equates ""abusive behavior""?

Memes are ""abusive""?

It was. I post at kia2. I saw the KF thread and the mod specifically said not to link to KF. There is no brigading going on at kia2.

"2743",200,"saint2e",11,1,1,9,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"2744",356,"etiolatezed",11,3,200,20,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"2745",357,"saint2e",11,3,356,3,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"2746",358,"etiolatezed",11,3,357,13,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"2747",359,"peenoid",11,3,356,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"2748",360,"etiolatezed",11,3,359,4,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"2749",361,"peenoid",11,3,360,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"2750",362,"etiolatezed",11,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"2759",371,"ClockworkFool",11,3,370,8,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

You're extremely bad at it, only managing to parade your bias for everyone to see, yet you double down and continue to push the same argument that has now been called out as ignoring crucial facts of the matter *twice*. Is it empathy? Do you feel empathy for the mods' power tripping and feel hurt by the attacks on them? You're not even a mod. You have no power to trip on."

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

You realized that so you deleted your comment while i think your bfs protected you in the comments.

Why are they shit, you ask?

We all mocked poor david for his autism, little did we know our mods are more mentally fucked than him.

Modding attracts a certain type of person. Someone who has a lot of free time to do shit for free. Basically someone who has a minimal social life, and thats an immediate red flag right there. All this hassle and they dont even get payed!!! Theyre emotionally invested in this internet forum in which everyone hates em but for the non existent silent majority.

"3018",200,"saint2e",12,1,1,10,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"3019",356,"etiolatezed",12,3,200,20,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"3020",357,"saint2e",12,3,356,1,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"3021",358,"etiolatezed",12,3,357,15,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"3022",359,"peenoid",12,3,356,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"3023",360,"etiolatezed",12,3,359,0,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"3024",361,"peenoid",12,3,360,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"3025",362,"etiolatezed",12,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"3034",371,"ClockworkFool",12,3,370,9,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire.

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

That said, I'm happy with how the new rule changes came out in the end and I think most of the sub realizes it's an improvement. If people want to start a different sub with different rules that's fine with me as well, just be aware the realities of reddit will eventually kick in.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

Smh telling me to link to a deleted comment. A guy was talking about how awful you were and said he was banned so you perma banned him and left  sweet comment. He later clarified that it was a previous incident that he was mistakenly banned by the mods (if you do your job well it shouldnt have happened) that he was referring to, that you assumed he was talking about using an account to evade a ban. You realized that so you deleted your comment while i think your bfs protected you in the comments.

You know something, im a realist and i think this whole clusterfuck will blow over soon, but the people will never forget, and they will never trust you. You and shadist will always be hated here till the end. 

But you, pinker, you will forever be known as the zoe quinn of kia, and i think you know what i mean by that.

You absolutely suck. Good luck with your mental health problems whatever they are this time. "

Yeah, that person was banned wrongly by sciencemile a while back, not by me.

When someone admits to ban-evading, we tend to crack the whip fairly quickly..

When it was determined that the person was wrong in that I **hadn't** banned them, they were unbanned.

Also, I didn't delete the comment. another mod removed it.  It's not deleted.  you can see it on ceddit if you want to go look:

Modding attracts a certain type of person. Someone who has a lot of free time to do shit for free. Basically someone who has a minimal social life, and thats an immediate red flag right there. All this hassle and they dont even get payed!!! Theyre emotionally invested in this internet forum in which everyone hates em but for the non existent silent majority. That shows me their lives are meaningless. 

Face it kia, most of our mods have some form of mental health problem. Bipolar disorder,  depression,  autism, anxiety,  etc. Abort ship or be ruled by idiots.

I wonder how many problems those three in particular have."

Ideally, they should be tarred and feathered and thrown out, but that's obviously not possible. Aside from just sucking it up, the community can either try to leave for another subreddit, but by doing so it risks self-destruction - most communities don't survive such moves. Another solution would be to make the current mod team feel extremely unwelcome - insult them on every turn, refuse to engage them in any sort of conversation other than calling them out on being unwelcome outsiders here. It might drive a few of them away, which could lead to changes in the power structure. At worst, it'll make them mad-butthurt and they'll crank up the censorship and destroy the community.

"3294",200,"saint2e",13,1,1,8,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"3295",356,"etiolatezed",13,3,200,17,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"3296",357,"saint2e",13,3,356,2,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"3297",358,"etiolatezed",13,3,357,13,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"3298",359,"peenoid",13,3,356,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"3299",360,"etiolatezed",13,3,359,1,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"3300",361,"peenoid",13,3,360,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"3301",362,"etiolatezed",13,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"3310",371,"ClockworkFool",13,3,370,6,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

A subreddit should be a reflection of what the subscribers desire. If the subscribers desire it to evolve, it should (within the site-wide rules). If they desire it to remain the same, it should.

The moderators have decided that they know best, and they should rule on the direction of the sub, even going so far as to hold and ignore the results of votes held to supposedly make decisions."

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.  Even in the main meta thread, it was stated by a couple mods the sub still sees 30k unique *daily* visitors, and before I stepped down, that was fairly consistent (somewhere around 300-350k uniques per month, IIRC).  The traffic page was hidden from public view by the admins, not the mods, and it doesn't take much effort to ask the mods what current traffic looks like - some mods actually like sharing that info."

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

"3391",3,"AntonioOfVenice",14,1,1,170,0,"They're still not allowing any meta topic on the new 'rules'.

**EDIT:** Maybe they do. Some moderator attacked me for 'spreading misinformation', I think for this post. Yet this is what I heard from one of the moderators (to be precise, that meta threads about the rules are banned for reasons of Rule 8, not because of the existence of a megathread, which a new announcement would not negate). Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

If meta threads regarding the rule change are no longer banned, good on them and credit where credit is due. "

There's literally a thread pinned on KiA2 expressing the idea that he doesn't see KiA2 as opposed to KiA, it's not the enemy and the hope is to somehow help make KiA ""Great Again"". "

Then the ""We should make antonio a mod here on KIA"" idea started circulated, and suddenly he was advocating for everybody to stay here and how the place needs to be changed from within. 

His position has consistently been whatever will give him power and attention.  Meanwhile, everything here is actually fine. 
"
"3401",10,"Notalent13",14,1,9,3,0,"To be fair, not everything was actually fine, the rule change was bungled badly in it's delivery, some mods interacted with posters in a shit manner, and some modmail's were handled terribly. 

That said, I'm happy with how the new rule changes came out in the end and I think most of the sub realizes it's an improvement. If people want to start a different sub with different rules that's fine with me as well, just be aware the realities of reddit will eventually kick in. This place isn't ideal for a lot of what we want and there isn't anything we can do about that until it gets a quality competitor with enough resources to do so. Partly that's why we still link to GGHQ on 8chan, and I'm looking into other alternative places for GG'ers to discuss things that won't be constricted by reddits rules or it's obnoxious primary user base of rabid progressives."

I think the mods should have leaned on KIAChatroom, maybe promoted it in a sticky or made it more obvious in some other way as the place for off topic shit/lightly moderated banter. 

And yeah, it's fine for people to start other subreddits of course. It's just a fact that those other subreddits will be ghost towns unless they convince people that *this* subreddit is in shambles so they can poach our members. "
"3403",513,"Notalent13",14,5,11,5,0,"I mean I post on KIAchatroom, but that place IS a ghost town, and any attempt to convince people to post shit there and not here has always been taken as incredibly divisive before, basically the equivalent to telling them to ""go elsewhere"".

I find it funny that you guys place this complete and total faith in upvotes/downvotes.   

Why do you think almost every single larger sub on reddit has rules (that are FAARR more restrictive than ours) about keeping things topical?   It's because people upvote shit.

yes. 

Here's the thing too.  We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down.  We used to have email campaigns and shit. 


I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald?   And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been.  They meme and shitpost hard.   We don't.

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."

"3578",358,"etiolatezed",14,3,357,14,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"3579",359,"peenoid",14,3,356,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"3580",360,"etiolatezed",14,3,359,3,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"3581",361,"peenoid",14,3,360,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"3582",362,"etiolatezed",14,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "
"3590",370,"saint2e",14,3,369,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from...

"3591",371,"ClockworkFool",14,3,370,6,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

If that is the only post, I wouldn't find it objectionable at all. But I think there is more, particularly since there are highly divergent views on what does or doesn't qualify as a given topic.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.

The traffic page was hidden from public view by the admins, not the mods, and it doesn't take much effort to ask the mods what current traffic looks like - some mods actually like sharing that info."

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

If people want to start a different sub with different rules that's fine with me as well, just be aware the realities of reddit will eventually kick in. This place isn't ideal for a lot of what we want and there isn't anything we can do about that until it gets a quality competitor with enough resources to do so.

No, as that is moderated by the same people, and they might just spring the same sort of thing on us there. In fact, I pointed this out in basically the only post where I talked about KIA2. Shows that you didn't even read it, that you are extremely poorly informed, despite claiming that you somehow know the truth here.

&gt; /r/KIAChatroom is an alternative as well, and given how they have shown how little they can be trusted by overturning our vote and implementing an option that was voted down 75-1, you never know what can happen at any moment.

Go right ahead and provide the receipts for that. 

The complete timeline is... you're not truthful, as I never said that ""KIA is kill"". I never encouraged anyone to ""abandon"" this place. I only asked for people who wanted to be moderators, that's basically the only time I mentioned my sub here.

I find it funny that you guys place this complete and total faith in upvotes/downvotes.   

Why do you think almost every single larger sub on reddit has rules (that are FAARR more restrictive than ours) about keeping things topical?   It's because people upvote shit. 

If we allowed memes, 90% of the page would be fucking memes.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"3864",356,"etiolatezed",15,3,200,19,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"3865",357,"saint2e",15,3,356,3,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"3866",358,"etiolatezed",15,3,357,12,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"3867",359,"peenoid",15,3,356,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"3868",360,"etiolatezed",15,3,359,1,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"3869",361,"peenoid",15,3,360,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"3870",362,"etiolatezed",15,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I can very well believe that overall the quality will be better, but at this point the rule change doesn't matter one bit, the fact that the mods didn't respect the community and after that even laughed at the community does.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "
"3878",370,"saint2e",15,3,369,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from...

"3879",371,"ClockworkFool",15,3,370,7,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

"3880",372,"saint2e",15,3,371,3,0,"In looking at AoV's submissions for the past month or so I can definitely see a few of those submissions not making the cut.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

If that is the only post, I wouldn't find it objectionable at all. But I think there is more, particularly since there are highly divergent views on what does or doesn't qualify as a given topic.

Of course things have obviously changed within the last few days and the mods aren't going to work too hard to keep him around anymore.  

It's still on him whether he can follow the rules or not though.  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago."

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.

The traffic page was hidden from public view by the admins, not the mods, and it doesn't take much effort to ask the mods what current traffic looks like - some mods actually like sharing that info."

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

If meta threads regarding the rule change are no longer banned, good on them and credit where credit is due. "

If people want to start a different sub with different rules that's fine with me as well, just be aware the realities of reddit will eventually kick in.

No, as that is moderated by the same people, and they might just spring the same sort of thing on us there. In fact, I pointed this out in basically the only post where I talked about KIA2. Shows that you didn't even read it, that you are extremely poorly informed, despite claiming that you somehow know the truth here.

&gt; /r/KIAChatroom is an alternative as well, and given how they have shown how little they can be trusted by overturning our vote and implementing an option that was voted down 75-1, you never know what can happen at any moment.

Go right ahead and provide the receipts for that.

I find it funny that you guys place this complete and total faith in upvotes/downvotes.   

Why do you think almost every single larger sub on reddit has rules (that are FAARR more restrictive than ours) about keeping things topical?   It's because people upvote shit.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

It might drive a few of them away, which could lead to changes in the power structure. At worst, it'll make them mad-butthurt and they'll crank up the censorship and destroy the community. Really, both options risk the destruction of the community, but at least in the latter case it won't be self-destruction."

"4151",200,"saint2e",16,1,1,8,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"4152",356,"etiolatezed",16,3,200,16,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"4153",357,"saint2e",16,3,356,3,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"4154",358,"etiolatezed",16,3,357,13,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"4155",359,"peenoid",16,3,356,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"4156",360,"etiolatezed",16,3,359,1,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"4157",361,"peenoid",16,3,360,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"4158",362,"etiolatezed",16,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "

"4167",371,"ClockworkFool",16,3,370,9,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.  Even in the main meta thread, it was stated by a couple mods the sub still sees 30k unique *daily* visitors, and before I stepped down, that was fairly consistent (somewhere around 300-350k uniques per month, IIRC).  The traffic page was hidden from public view by the admins, not the mods, and it doesn't take much effort to ask the mods what current traffic looks like - some mods actually like sharing that info."

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

If meta threads regarding the rule change are no longer banned, good on them and credit where credit is due. "

If people want to start a different sub with different rules that's fine with me as well, just be aware the realities of reddit will eventually kick in.

No, as that is moderated by the same people, and they might just spring the same sort of thing on us there. In fact, I pointed this out in basically the only post where I talked about KIA2. Shows that you didn't even read it, that you are extremely poorly informed, despite claiming that you somehow know the truth here.

&gt; /r/KIAChatroom is an alternative as well, and given how they have shown how little they can be trusted by overturning our vote and implementing an option that was voted down 75-1, you never know what can happen at any moment.

Go right ahead and provide the receipts for that. 

The complete timeline is... you're not truthful, as I never said that ""KIA is kill"". I never encouraged anyone to ""abandon"" this place. I only asked for people who wanted to be moderators, that's basically the only time I mentioned my sub here.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago.

Smh telling me to link to a deleted comment. A guy was talking about how awful you were and said he was banned so you perma banned him and left  sweet comment. He later clarified that it was a previous incident that he was mistakenly banned by the mods (if you do your job well it shouldnt have happened) that he was referring to, that you assumed he was talking about using an account to evade a ban. You realized that so you deleted your comment while i think your bfs protected you in the comments.

You know something, im a realist and i think this whole clusterfuck will blow over soon, but the people will never forget, and they will never trust you. You and shadist will always be hated here till the end. 

But you, pinker, you will forever be known as the zoe quinn of kia, and i think you know what i mean by that.

You absolutely suck. Good luck with your mental health problems whatever they are this time. "

Yeah, that person was banned wrongly by sciencemile a while back, not by me.

When someone admits to ban-evading, we tend to crack the whip fairly quickly..

When it was determined that the person was wrong in that I **hadn't** banned them, they were unbanned.

Also, I didn't delete the comment. another mod removed it.  It's not deleted.  you can see it on ceddit if you want to go look:

An apology especially from shadistsreddit targetlocked and pinkerbell. The worst of the worst. The ones we all endured even before the new rules. Lets face it they were shit before and theyre doubly shit now. 

Why are they shit, you ask? Im no gambler, but if i had to bet id say its because they contain a vile mixture of: pride, narcissism, general assholery, lust for power, self importance, and, most importantly, mental health problems.  We all mocked poor david for his autism, little did we know our mods are more mentally fucked than him.

Modding attracts a certain type of person. Someone who has a lot of free time to do shit for free. Basically someone who has a minimal social life, and thats an immediate red flag right there. All this hassle and they dont even get payed!!! Theyre emotionally invested in this internet forum in which everyone hates em but for the non existent silent majority. That shows me their lives are meaningless. 

Face it kia, most of our mods have some form of mental health problem. Bipolar disorder,  depression,  autism, anxiety,  etc. Abort ship or be ruled by idiots.

Ideally, they should be tarred and feathered and thrown out, but that's obviously not possible. Aside from just sucking it up, the community can either try to leave for another subreddit, but by doing so it risks self-destruction - most communities don't survive such moves. Another solution would be to make the current mod team feel extremely unwelcome - insult them on every turn, refuse to engage them in any sort of conversation other than calling them out on being unwelcome outsiders here. It might drive a few of them away, which could lead to changes in the power structure. At worst, it'll make them mad-butthurt and they'll crank up the censorship and destroy the community.

"4439",200,"saint2e",17,1,1,9,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"4440",356,"etiolatezed",17,3,200,18,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"4441",357,"saint2e",17,3,356,2,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"4442",358,"etiolatezed",17,3,357,15,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"4443",359,"peenoid",17,3,356,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"4444",360,"etiolatezed",17,3,359,3,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"4445",361,"peenoid",17,3,360,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"4446",362,"etiolatezed",17,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"4455",371,"ClockworkFool",17,3,370,8,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

A subreddit should be a reflection of what the subscribers desire. If the subscribers desire it to evolve, it should (within the site-wide rules). If they desire it to remain the same, it should.

The moderators have decided that they know best, and they should rule on the direction of the sub, even going so far as to hold and ignore the results of votes held to supposedly make decisions."

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

No, as that is moderated by the same people, and they might just spring the same sort of thing on us there. In fact, I pointed this out in basically the only post where I talked about KIA2. Shows that you didn't even read it, that you are extremely poorly informed, despite claiming that you somehow know the truth here.

&gt; /r/KIAChatroom is an alternative as well, and given how they have shown how little they can be trusted by overturning our vote and implementing an option that was voted down 75-1, you never know what can happen at any moment.

Go right ahead and provide the receipts for that.

Sorry, but I don't think we need a vote on that.    

&gt;and not reddit's self-correcting voting system controlled by the community

I find it funny that you guys place this complete and total faith in upvotes/downvotes.   

Why do you think almost every single larger sub on reddit has rules (that are FAARR more restrictive than ours) about keeping things topical?   It's because people upvote shit. 

If we allowed memes, 90% of the page would be fucking memes.

There's a reasonable argument that they helped win a Presidential election. Many threads end up being about memes like NPC and learntocode.

I realize I'm probably in more of a minority on this than even the mods, but this is something I just fundamentally don't understand. If the goal is to make an impact on a culture war, why kneecap ourselves on a communication tool in widespread use by... uh... culture.

yes. 

Here's the thing too.  We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down.  We used to have email campaigns and shit. 


I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald?   And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been.  They meme and shitpost hard.   We don't.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

You realized that so you deleted your comment while i think your bfs protected you in the comments.

If you swallowed your pride for just a few seconds to write a rosy comment about how sorry you are (i dont mean that collective one that was shat out) then this entire shitstorm wouldnt have happened.

An apology especially from shadistsreddit targetlocked and pinkerbell. The worst of the worst. The ones we all endured even before the new rules. Lets face it they were shit before and theyre doubly shit now. 

Why are they shit, you ask? Im no gambler, but if i had to bet id say its because they contain a vile mixture of: pride, narcissism, general assholery, lust for power, self importance, and, most importantly, mental health problems.  We all mocked poor david for his autism, little did we know our mods are more mentally fucked than him.

Modding attracts a certain type of person. Someone who has a lot of free time to do shit for free. Basically someone who has a minimal social life, and thats an immediate red flag right there. All this hassle and they dont even get payed!!! Theyre emotionally invested in this internet forum in which everyone hates em but for the non existent silent majority. That shows me their lives are meaningless. 

Face it kia, most of our mods have some form of mental health problem. Bipolar disorder,  depression,  autism, anxiety,  etc. Abort ship or be ruled by idiots.

Another solution would be to make the current mod team feel extremely unwelcome - insult them on every turn, refuse to engage them in any sort of conversation other than calling them out on being unwelcome outsiders here. It might drive a few of them away, which could lead to changes in the power structure. At worst, it'll make them mad-butthurt and they'll crank up the censorship and destroy the community.

"4728",200,"saint2e",18,1,1,9,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"4729",356,"etiolatezed",18,3,200,18,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"4730",357,"saint2e",18,3,356,2,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"4731",358,"etiolatezed",18,3,357,16,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"4732",359,"peenoid",18,3,356,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"4733",360,"etiolatezed",18,3,359,3,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"4734",361,"peenoid",18,3,360,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"4735",362,"etiolatezed",18,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "
"4743",370,"saint2e",18,3,369,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from...

"4744",371,"ClockworkFool",18,3,370,7,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire.

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

"4784",411,"peenoid",18,3,200,2,0,"&gt; Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult. I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

This prompts the question: is there ""better"" content that was being suppressed by the stuff you aren't interested in, or will the self-post change ultimately result in _less_ content overall (and you're just noticing more of the stuff you like although the total volume of it has remained the same)?

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Can you give some specific examples of the stuff you were seeing before vs what's here now? Because as a daily visitor I'm honestly not seeing much of a difference."

And as I said, there's still some stuff on the front page that I ""eye roll and scroll on"", but there seems to be less overall.

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

No, as that is moderated by the same people, and they might just spring the same sort of thing on us there. In fact, I pointed this out in basically the only post where I talked about KIA2. Shows that you didn't even read it, that you are extremely poorly informed, despite claiming that you somehow know the truth here.

&gt; /r/KIAChatroom is an alternative as well, and given how they have shown how little they can be trusted by overturning our vote and implementing an option that was voted down 75-1, you never know what can happen at any moment.

Why do you think almost every single larger sub on reddit has rules (that are FAARR more restrictive than ours) about keeping things topical?   It's because people upvote shit.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

You realized that so you deleted your comment while i think your bfs protected you in the comments.

Why are they shit, you ask?

We all mocked poor david for his autism, little did we know our mods are more mentally fucked than him.

Modding attracts a certain type of person. Someone who has a lot of free time to do shit for free. Basically someone who has a minimal social life, and thats an immediate red flag right there. All this hassle and they dont even get payed!!! Theyre emotionally invested in this internet forum in which everyone hates em but for the non existent silent majority.

"5018",200,"saint2e",19,1,1,9,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"5019",356,"etiolatezed",19,3,200,19,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"5020",357,"saint2e",19,3,356,4,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"5021",358,"etiolatezed",19,3,357,12,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"5022",359,"peenoid",19,3,356,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"5023",360,"etiolatezed",19,3,359,3,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"5024",361,"peenoid",19,3,360,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"5025",362,"etiolatezed",19,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"5034",371,"ClockworkFool",19,3,370,7,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire.

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

This prompts the question: is there ""better"" content that was being suppressed by the stuff you aren't interested in, or will the self-post change ultimately result in _less_ content overall (and you're just noticing more of the stuff you like although the total volume of it has remained the same)?

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Can you give some specific examples of the stuff you were seeing before vs what's here now? Because as a daily visitor I'm honestly not seeing much of a difference."

The moderators have decided that they know best, and they should rule on the direction of the sub, even going so far as to hold and ignore the results of votes - votes supposedly held to make decisions."

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

No, as that is moderated by the same people, and they might just spring the same sort of thing on us there. In fact, I pointed this out in basically the only post where I talked about KIA2. Shows that you didn't even read it, that you are extremely poorly informed, despite claiming that you somehow know the truth here.

&gt; /r/KIAChatroom is an alternative as well, and given how they have shown how little they can be trusted by overturning our vote and implementing an option that was voted down 75-1, you never know what can happen at any moment.

"5134",600,"AntonioOfVenice",20,7,9,1,0,"&gt; The complete timeline is Antonio declaring KIA to be kill and encouraging everybody to abandon this place for his subreddit, KIA2.

Go right ahead and provide the receipts for that. 

The complete timeline is... you're not truthful, as I never said that ""KIA is kill"". I never encouraged anyone to ""abandon"" this place. I only asked for people who wanted to be moderators, that's basically the only time I mentioned my sub here.

&gt;  He gained a few subs, nothing really remarkable

I expected 300-400 subs at best. I got 3000. 

&gt; Then the ""We should make antonio a mod here on KIA"" idea started circulated

You do realize that this co-incided with various moderators REEEEEE'ing at me for absolutely no reason, right? I've never wanted to be a moderator here, despite encouragement now and before. I'm not crazy, and the moderators would sooner shut this sub down than give it to me.

I find it funny that you guys place this complete and total faith in upvotes/downvotes.   

Why do you think almost every single larger sub on reddit has rules (that are FAARR more restrictive than ours) about keeping things topical?   It's because people upvote shit.

yes.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

Posting a single meme pic of confused black guy when you're making absurd claims that a mod is lying about what's in a link when you say he didn't even click it, but his ""lies"" about the link 100% fit what's inside the link.  How is that even possible?

&gt;That's the deal. I find it hilarious you want me to show you things that have been deleted. Do the users need to start archiving all the mod posts? Is it that bad? I show you two examples of bad behavior. I show you lying about brigading. You deny it despite people being able to find the truth themselves.

The Mnemosyne bots auto-archive all posts.  Additionally there's our public modlog as well as ceddit that you can use to back up your claims.

You said ""abusive behavior by mods like pinkerbelle""

I'm not here to talk about the behavior of other mods. I'm here to talk about your claim that I'm abusive.

You realized that so you deleted your comment while i think your bfs protected you in the comments.

You know something, im a realist and i think this whole clusterfuck will blow over soon, but the people will never forget, and they will never trust you. You and shadist will always be hated here till the end.

Why are they shit, you ask? Im no gambler, but if i had to bet id say its because they contain a vile mixture of: pride, narcissism, general assholery, lust for power, self importance, and, most importantly, mental health problems.  We all mocked poor david for his autism, little did we know our mods are more mentally fucked than him.

Modding attracts a certain type of person. Someone who has a lot of free time to do shit for free. Basically someone who has a minimal social life, and thats an immediate red flag right there. All this hassle and they dont even get payed!!! Theyre emotionally invested in this internet forum in which everyone hates em but for the non existent silent majority.

Another solution would be to make the current mod team feel extremely unwelcome - insult them on every turn, refuse to engage them in any sort of conversation other than calling them out on being unwelcome outsiders here. It might drive a few of them away, which could lead to changes in the power structure. At worst, it'll make them mad-butthurt and they'll crank up the censorship and destroy the community.

"5309",200,"saint2e",20,1,1,7,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"5310",356,"etiolatezed",20,3,200,19,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"5311",357,"saint2e",20,3,356,1,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"5312",358,"etiolatezed",20,3,357,14,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"5313",359,"peenoid",20,3,356,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"5314",360,"etiolatezed",20,3,359,1,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"5315",361,"peenoid",20,3,360,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"5316",362,"etiolatezed",20,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"5325",371,"ClockworkFool",20,3,370,8,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire.

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Can you give some specific examples of the stuff you were seeing before vs what's here now? Because as a daily visitor I'm honestly not seeing much of a difference."

The moderators have decided that they know best, and they should rule on the direction of the sub, even going so far as to hold and ignore the results of votes - votes supposedly held to make decisions."

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

If people want to start a different sub with different rules that's fine with me as well, just be aware the realities of reddit will eventually kick in. This place isn't ideal for a lot of what we want and there isn't anything we can do about that until it gets a quality competitor with enough resources to do so.

No, as that is moderated by the same people, and they might just spring the same sort of thing on us there. In fact, I pointed this out in basically the only post where I talked about KIA2. Shows that you didn't even read it, that you are extremely poorly informed, despite claiming that you somehow know the truth here.

&gt; /r/KIAChatroom is an alternative as well, and given how they have shown how little they can be trusted by overturning our vote and implementing an option that was voted down 75-1, you never know what can happen at any moment.

I find it funny that you guys place this complete and total faith in upvotes/downvotes.   

Why do you think almost every single larger sub on reddit has rules (that are FAARR more restrictive than ours) about keeping things topical?   It's because people upvote shit.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

"5499",57,"pinkerbelle",21,1,56,-8,0,"&gt; You delete a lot, but here's something from today:

No I didn't.  If you claim I deleted something, show proof of it.  

&gt;You falsely claiming that kia2 is brigading.

It wasn't a false accusation. Despite what the mod of that sub says, go look at the public modlog for that sub.  The top item in it right now is a post removal that was calling for KiA2 users to come here and disrupt the sub.

It was allowed to stay up for 7 hours.

&gt;shiutposting in reply to a moderation issue:

4-month old post where not only was I not shitposting, I was legitimately confused about what the person accusing Hessmix of lying was talking about. did you read the entire context or just find a single meme-reply and decide that somehow equates ""abusive behavior""?

Memes are ""abusive""?

EDIT: OH!! LOL!  That was you!

You never did explain how Hessmix was lying about a post while at the same time claiming he never clicked it, making it impossible for him to lie about something he hadn't even read."
"5500",58,"etiolatezed",21,1,57,15,0,"&gt; It wasn't a false accusation.

It was. I post at kia2. I saw the KF thread and the mod specifically said not to link to KF. There is no brigading going on at kia2.

""I'm not shitposting. I'm not lying.""

Let me add: I'm not accountable.

That's the deal. I find it hilarious you want me to show you things that have been deleted. Do the users need to start archiving all the mod posts? Is it that bad?  I show you two examples of bad behavior. I show you lying about brigading. You deny it despite people being able to find the truth themselves.

Here, figure this one out: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/361746005462351877/508033889873166353/imgoingin.png

What's your opinion on this behavior? Mods encouraging former mods to attack users? Will you deny this. Are you in this private mod discord? Do you think this is right?

Posting a single meme pic of confused black guy when you're making absurd claims that a mod is lying about what's in a link when you say he didn't even click it, but his ""lies"" about the link 100% fit what's inside the link.  How is that even possible?

The Mnemosyne bots auto-archive all posts.  Additionally there's our public modlog as well as ceddit that you can use to back up your claims.

You said ""abusive behavior by mods like pinkerbelle""

I'm not here to talk about the behavior of other mods. I'm here to talk about your claim that I'm abusive.

Smh telling me to link to a deleted comment. A guy was talking about how awful you were and said he was banned so you perma banned him and left  sweet comment. He later clarified that it was a previous incident that he was mistakenly banned by the mods (if you do your job well it shouldnt have happened) that he was referring to, that you assumed he was talking about using an account to evade a ban. You realized that so you deleted your comment while i think your bfs protected you in the comments.

You know something, im a realist and i think this whole clusterfuck will blow over soon, but the people will never forget, and they will never trust you. You and shadist will always be hated here till the end. 

But you, pinker, you will forever be known as the zoe quinn of kia, and i think you know what i mean by that.

Posts that were linking to articles where the Media failure isn't the highlight(or even in the story), but chooses to focus on MAGA hats and/or Trump, would be removed, as would self-posts that were promoting the fact that the media bias was purely political.

Media political bias isn't ""Media Ethics"" it's just bias.

The failure of the Media to fact-check the incident with the Covington kids, and the failure to vet ""Native Elder and Vietnam Vet"" is ""Media Ethics""

"5600",200,"saint2e",21,1,1,11,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"5601",356,"etiolatezed",21,3,200,17,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"5602",357,"saint2e",21,3,356,4,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"5603",358,"etiolatezed",21,3,357,15,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"5604",359,"peenoid",21,3,356,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"5605",360,"etiolatezed",21,3,359,2,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"5606",361,"peenoid",21,3,360,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"5607",362,"etiolatezed",21,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"5616",371,"ClockworkFool",21,3,370,9,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

That you can rationalize why this measure could potentially somehow be beneficial doesn't really change anything other than expose your bias."

While people are disturbed that the mod team not only ignored the wishes of the community, but did so smugly and then spent two additional days doing nothing but insulting anyone who disagrees, you pipe up with ""Oh hey, but here's why maybe what they did is beneficial, and maybe that's why they did it!"" Except, it's neither particularly beneficial, nor is it the reason they did it - or they would have said so.

This prompts the question: is there ""better"" content that was being suppressed by the stuff you aren't interested in, or will the self-post change ultimately result in _less_ content overall (and you're just noticing more of the stuff you like although the total volume of it has remained the same)?

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Can you give some specific examples of the stuff you were seeing before vs what's here now? Because as a daily visitor I'm honestly not seeing much of a difference."
"5657",412,"saint2e",21,3,411,2,0,"Yeah time will tell on the ""better content"" or if it's just a coincedence.

The moderators have decided that they know best, and they should rule on the direction of the sub, even going so far as to hold and ignore the results of votes - votes supposedly held to make decisions."

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

Which is a real screenshot, since it comes from Bane himself: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/9tngex/meta_the_moderation_has_become_an_unaccountable/e8xuz9x/


This is what the mods have become. People want them to revert the rule change all step down. There's been other abusive behavior by mods like pinkerbelle, iamsupernova and shadist. Mods like Hessmix who don't do the abuse in the sub instead encourage it in the private discord. "

It wasn't a false accusation. Despite what the mod of that sub says, go look at the public modlog for that sub.  The top item in it right now is a post removal that was calling for KiA2 users to come here and disrupt the sub.

4-month old post where not only was I not shitposting, I was legitimately confused about what the person accusing Hessmix of lying was talking about. did you read the entire context or just find a single meme-reply and decide that somehow equates ""abusive behavior""?

"5891",200,"saint2e",22,1,1,9,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"5892",356,"etiolatezed",22,3,200,17,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"5893",357,"saint2e",22,3,356,4,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"5894",358,"etiolatezed",22,3,357,14,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"5895",359,"peenoid",22,3,356,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"5896",360,"etiolatezed",22,3,359,3,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"5897",361,"peenoid",22,3,360,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"5898",362,"etiolatezed",22,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"5907",371,"ClockworkFool",22,3,370,9,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

Is it empathy? Do you feel empathy for the mods' power tripping and feel hurt by the attacks on them? You're not even a mod. You have no power to trip on."

"5923",387,"ClockworkFool",22,3,200,9,0,"&gt;But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions. "

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

"6182",200,"saint2e",23,1,1,8,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"6183",356,"etiolatezed",23,3,200,17,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"6184",357,"saint2e",23,3,356,2,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"6185",358,"etiolatezed",23,3,357,14,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"6186",359,"peenoid",23,3,356,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"6187",360,"etiolatezed",23,3,359,1,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"6188",361,"peenoid",23,3,360,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"6189",362,"etiolatezed",23,3,361,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"6198",371,"ClockworkFool",23,3,370,10,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

It's still on him whether he can follow the rules or not though.  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago."
"6202",375,"ClockworkFool",23,3,374,7,0,"&gt;Which one?

Perhaps you should ask Antonio, or the other mods in your discord if you'd like specifics? It's not my place to get involved any more than I already have. "
"6203",376,"AntonioOfVenice",23,3,374,8,0,"&gt; Which one? I don't recall this particular venture

Was in the modmail, at least the admission. I heard something like: ""I wanted to take action for D&amp;C but after consulting with other mods couldn't."" I don't want to name people, because that might put a target on them.

&gt;  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago.

I do."

"6207",380,"saint2e",23,3,379,0,1,"Or perhaps the mods were taking the admittedly bold strategy of doing what they felt would be right in the long run, even if it went against the grain of the subreddit.

"6208",381,"Carkudo",23,3,380,3,0,"&gt; Or perhaps the mods were taking the admittedly bold strategy of doing what they felt would be right

Then why did they feel the need to repeatedly change their stated motivation for doing so and to insult members of the community who spoke out against it? I get that you're desperate to defend the mods now, but you're really not thinking this through, so your bullshit is easy to see through. 

Here's a question for you though: *why* are you so desperate to defend them? You're extremely bad at it, only managing to parade your bias for everyone to see, yet you double down and continue to push the same argument that has now been called out as ignoring crucial facts of the matter *twice*. Is it empathy? Do you feel empathy for the mods' power tripping and feel hurt by the attacks on them? You're not even a mod. You have no power to trip on."

"6214",387,"ClockworkFool",23,3,200,10,0,"&gt;But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions. "
"6215",388,"saint2e",23,3,387,4,0,"And that's basically my disclaimer at the end with the sample size.  ""So far, not so bad"" is essentially my point.  But we'll see if that continues."

"6217",390,"saint2e",23,3,389,2,0,"Yup.  It'd be nice to get away from the YouTuber drama and other tangents, and if that persists, I'd be okay with that."
"6218",391,"Carkudo",23,3,200,10,0,"Except, the reasoning you're providing now is not the same as the reasoning provided by the mods. Not the same as any of them, as they themselves can't seem to settle on any particular reason why they even needed to fuck over the community in the first place, which is a strong indicator that they did so for shit and giggles. That you can rationalize why this measure could potentially somehow be beneficial doesn't really change anything other than expose your bias."
"6219",392,"saint2e",23,3,391,1,1,"All I'm saying is that ""so far, not so bad"", and adding a disclaimer that it's only been a week or so."
"6220",393,"Carkudo",23,3,392,6,0,"Exactly. While people are disturbed that the mod team not only ignored the wishes of the community, but did so smugly and then spent two additional days doing nothing but insulting anyone who disagrees, you pipe up with ""Oh hey, but here's why maybe what they did is beneficial, and maybe that's why they did it!"" Except, it's neither particularly beneficial, nor is it the reason they did it - or they would have said so. You're rationalizing something irrational, and the only thing you achieve by doing so is showing everyone that you're biased in favor of the mod team."
"6221",394,"saint2e",23,3,393,3,1,"Well see if it was the right call in the long run I suppose."
"6222",568,"Carkudo",23,5,394,6,0,"Yes, you've already said that - that's your mantra. First you try to rationalize, then when your bullshit is called out you blank out and start repeating a mantra.  That's the kind of person you are."
"6223",569,"saint2e",23,5,568,2,0,"It's my opinion and I'm sticking to it!"

"6237",410,"saint2e",23,3,409,2,0,"I don't usually downvote anything.  I just scroll past.  Lately I've had to do less scrolling (once all the meta posts disappeared, save for this one).

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

"6477",205,"saint2e",24,1,1,7,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"6478",413,"etiolatezed",24,3,205,18,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"6479",694,"saint2e",24,24,413,1,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"6480",695,"etiolatezed",24,24,694,15,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"6481",696,"peenoid",24,24,413,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"6482",697,"etiolatezed",24,24,696,0,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"6483",698,"peenoid",24,24,697,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"6484",699,"etiolatezed",24,24,698,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "
"6492",707,"saint2e",24,24,706,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from... 

I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about."
"6493",708,"ClockworkFool",24,24,707,10,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned. "
"6494",709,"saint2e",24,24,708,4,0,"In looking at AoV's submissions for the past month or so I can definitely see a few of those submissions not making the cut.  Personally speaking, the one about IMC I would've scrolled right by without clicking, that one probably wouldn't have made it, and perhaps rightly so in my estimation.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

The bulk of them all centre around Journalistic Ethics IMHO, and thus would've been fine, I would've thought."

Personally speaking, the one about IMC I would've scrolled right by without clicking, that one probably wouldn't have made it, and perhaps rightly so in my estimation.

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

If that is the only post, I wouldn't find it objectionable at all. But I think there is more, particularly since there are highly divergent views on what does or doesn't qualify as a given topic.

Still, it's all peanuts compared to the way it was done. "
"6496",711,"target_locked",24,24,708,-5,0,"&gt;  and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned. 

Which one?  I don't recall this particular venture, though AoV has a laundry list of rule violating here, we've actually gone above and beyond to keep him around.  Of course things have obviously changed within the last few days and the mods aren't going to work too hard to keep him around anymore.  

It's still on him whether he can follow the rules or not though.  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago."
"6497",712,"ClockworkFool",24,24,711,8,0,"&gt;Which one?

Perhaps you should ask Antonio, or the other mods in your discord if you'd like specifics? It's not my place to get involved any more than I already have. "
"6498",713,"AntonioOfVenice",24,24,711,6,0,"&gt; Which one? I don't recall this particular venture

Was in the modmail, at least the admission. I heard something like: ""I wanted to take action for D&amp;C but after consulting with other mods couldn't."" I don't want to name people, because that might put a target on them.

&gt;  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago.

I do."

Then why did they feel the need to repeatedly change their stated motivation for doing so and to insult members of the community who spoke out against it? I get that you're desperate to defend the mods now, but you're really not thinking this through, so your bullshit is easy to see through. 

Here's a question for you though: *why* are you so desperate to defend them? You're extremely bad at it, only managing to parade your bias for everyone to see, yet you double down and continue to push the same argument that has now been called out as ignoring crucial facts of the matter *twice*. Is it empathy? Do you feel empathy for the mods' power tripping and feel hurt by the attacks on them? You're not even a mod. You have no power to trip on."

"6509",724,"ClockworkFool",24,24,205,10,0,"&gt;But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions. "
"6510",725,"saint2e",24,24,724,5,0,"And that's basically my disclaimer at the end with the sample size.  ""So far, not so bad"" is essentially my point.  But we'll see if that continues."

"6512",727,"saint2e",24,24,726,2,0,"Yup.  It'd be nice to get away from the YouTuber drama and other tangents, and if that persists, I'd be okay with that."
"6513",728,"Carkudo",24,24,205,8,0,"Except, the reasoning you're providing now is not the same as the reasoning provided by the mods.

"6515",730,"Carkudo",24,24,729,6,0,"Exactly. While people are disturbed that the mod team not only ignored the wishes of the community, but did so smugly and then spent two additional days doing nothing but insulting anyone who disagrees, you pipe up with ""Oh hey, but here's why maybe what they did is beneficial, and maybe that's why they did it!"" Except, it's neither particularly beneficial, nor is it the reason they did it - or they would have said so. You're rationalizing something irrational, and the only thing you achieve by doing so is showing everyone that you're biased in favor of the mod team."
"6516",731,"saint2e",24,24,730,3,1,"Well see if it was the right call in the long run I suppose."

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

For all people know, all these brigades are of posts that would pass under the new rules, so what have you proven then?

"6768",205,"saint2e",25,1,1,9,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"6769",413,"etiolatezed",25,3,205,19,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"

"
"6772",696,"peenoid",25,24,413,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"6773",697,"etiolatezed",25,24,696,2,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"6774",698,"peenoid",25,24,697,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"6775",699,"etiolatezed",25,24,698,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I can very well believe that overall the quality will be better, but at this point the rule change doesn't matter one bit, the fact that the mods didn't respect the community and after that even laughed at the community does.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "
"6783",707,"saint2e",25,24,706,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from...

"6784",708,"ClockworkFool",25,24,707,7,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

"6785",709,"saint2e",25,24,708,3,0,"In looking at AoV's submissions for the past month or so I can definitely see a few of those submissions not making the cut.  Personally speaking, the one about IMC I would've scrolled right by without clicking, that one probably wouldn't have made it, and perhaps rightly so in my estimation.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

The bulk of them all centre around Journalistic Ethics IMHO, and thus would've been fine, I would've thought."

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

If that is the only post, I wouldn't find it objectionable at all. But I think there is more, particularly since there are highly divergent views on what does or doesn't qualify as a given topic.

Which one?  I don't recall this particular venture, though AoV has a laundry list of rule violating here, we've actually gone above and beyond to keep him around.  Of course things have obviously changed within the last few days and the mods aren't going to work too hard to keep him around anymore.  

It's still on him whether he can follow the rules or not though.  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago."

Then why did they feel the need to repeatedly change their stated motivation for doing so and to insult members of the community who spoke out against it? I get that you're desperate to defend the mods now, but you're really not thinking this through, so your bullshit is easy to see through. 

Here's a question for you though: *why* are you so desperate to defend them? You're extremely bad at it, only managing to parade your bias for everyone to see, yet you double down and continue to push the same argument that has now been called out as ignoring crucial facts of the matter *twice*.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

"7059",205,"saint2e",26,1,1,8,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"7060",413,"etiolatezed",26,3,205,17,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"7061",694,"saint2e",26,24,413,1,0,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "

"
"7063",696,"peenoid",26,24,413,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"7064",697,"etiolatezed",26,24,696,0,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"7065",698,"peenoid",26,24,697,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"7066",699,"etiolatezed",26,24,698,1,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading. 

Know the difference between an explanation and an excuse. "

I can very well believe that overall the quality will be better, but at this point the rule change doesn't matter one bit, the fact that the mods didn't respect the community and after that even laughed at the community does.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "
"7074",707,"saint2e",26,24,706,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from... 

I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about."
"7075",708,"ClockworkFool",26,24,707,8,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned. "
"7076",709,"saint2e",26,24,708,4,0,"In looking at AoV's submissions for the past month or so I can definitely see a few of those submissions not making the cut.  Personally speaking, the one about IMC I would've scrolled right by without clicking, that one probably wouldn't have made it, and perhaps rightly so in my estimation.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

The bulk of them all centre around Journalistic Ethics IMHO, and thus would've been fine, I would've thought."

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

If that is the only post, I wouldn't find it objectionable at all. But I think there is more, particularly since there are highly divergent views on what does or doesn't qualify as a given topic.

Still, it's all peanuts compared to the way it was done. "

Which one?  I don't recall this particular venture, though AoV has a laundry list of rule violating here, we've actually gone above and beyond to keep him around.  Of course things have obviously changed within the last few days and the mods aren't going to work too hard to keep him around anymore.  

It's still on him whether he can follow the rules or not though.  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago."
"7079",712,"ClockworkFool",26,24,711,6,0,"&gt;Which one?

Then why did they feel the need to repeatedly change their stated motivation for doing so and to insult members of the community who spoke out against it? I get that you're desperate to defend the mods now, but you're really not thinking this through, so your bullshit is easy to see through. 

Here's a question for you though: *why* are you so desperate to defend them? You're extremely bad at it, only managing to parade your bias for everyone to see, yet you double down and continue to push the same argument that has now been called out as ignoring crucial facts of the matter *twice*.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

If people want to start a different sub with different rules that's fine with me as well, just be aware the realities of reddit will eventually kick in.

No, as that is moderated by the same people, and they might just spring the same sort of thing on us there. In fact, I pointed this out in basically the only post where I talked about KIA2. Shows that you didn't even read it, that you are extremely poorly informed, despite claiming that you somehow know the truth here.

&gt; /r/KIAChatroom is an alternative as well, and given how they have shown how little they can be trusted by overturning our vote and implementing an option that was voted down 75-1, you never know what can happen at any moment.

Go right ahead and provide the receipts for that. 

The complete timeline is... you're not truthful, as I never said that ""KIA is kill"". I never encouraged anyone to ""abandon"" this place. I only asked for people who wanted to be moderators, that's basically the only time I mentioned my sub here.

I find it funny that you guys place this complete and total faith in upvotes/downvotes.   

Why do you think almost every single larger sub on reddit has rules (that are FAARR more restrictive than ours) about keeping things topical?   It's because people upvote shit.

yes. 

Here's the thing too.  We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down.  We used to have email campaigns and shit. 


I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald?   And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been.  They meme and shitpost hard.   We don't.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

"7350",205,"saint2e",27,1,1,10,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"7351",413,"etiolatezed",27,3,205,19,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways.

"7354",696,"peenoid",27,24,413,-3,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"7355",697,"etiolatezed",27,24,696,3,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"7356",698,"peenoid",27,24,697,-1,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"7357",699,"etiolatezed",27,24,698,2,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading. 

Know the difference between an explanation and an excuse. "

Point being, being a mod doesn't mean you take care of the sub for yourself, but for the whole community. And part of that means listening to the community, taking the 1% option that only had 2 votes is the polar opposite of that.

I can very well believe that overall the quality will be better, but at this point the rule change doesn't matter one bit, the fact that the mods didn't respect the community and after that even laughed at the community does.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "
"7365",707,"saint2e",27,24,706,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from... 

I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about."
"7366",708,"ClockworkFool",27,24,707,8,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned. "
"7367",709,"saint2e",27,24,708,4,0,"In looking at AoV's submissions for the past month or so I can definitely see a few of those submissions not making the cut.  Personally speaking, the one about IMC I would've scrolled right by without clicking, that one probably wouldn't have made it, and perhaps rightly so in my estimation.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

The bulk of them all centre around Journalistic Ethics IMHO, and thus would've been fine, I would've thought."

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

If that is the only post, I wouldn't find it objectionable at all. But I think there is more, particularly since there are highly divergent views on what does or doesn't qualify as a given topic.

Which one?  I don't recall this particular venture, though AoV has a laundry list of rule violating here, we've actually gone above and beyond to keep him around.  Of course things have obviously changed within the last few days and the mods aren't going to work too hard to keep him around anymore.  

It's still on him whether he can follow the rules or not though.  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago."

You're extremely bad at it, only managing to parade your bias for everyone to see, yet you double down and continue to push the same argument that has now been called out as ignoring crucial facts of the matter *twice*.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

No, as that is moderated by the same people, and they might just spring the same sort of thing on us there. In fact, I pointed this out in basically the only post where I talked about KIA2. Shows that you didn't even read it, that you are extremely poorly informed, despite claiming that you somehow know the truth here.

&gt; /r/KIAChatroom is an alternative as well, and given how they have shown how little they can be trusted by overturning our vote and implementing an option that was voted down 75-1, you never know what can happen at any moment.

Go right ahead and provide the receipts for that.

Why do you think almost every single larger sub on reddit has rules (that are FAARR more restrictive than ours) about keeping things topical?   It's because people upvote shit. 

If we allowed memes, 90% of the page would be fucking memes.

There's a reasonable argument that they helped win a Presidential election. Many threads end up being about memes like NPC and learntocode.

I realize I'm probably in more of a minority on this than even the mods, but this is something I just fundamentally don't understand. If the goal is to make an impact on a culture war, why kneecap ourselves on a communication tool in widespread use by... uh... culture.

Our goal is just to *talk* about the culture war? And this is a position that's sustainable... indefinitely?"

In moderation?  Nothing. 

But we've tried ""no moderation"" weeks before, and memes are like a fucking plague that just sweeps across the entire sub. 

&gt;If the goal is to make an impact on a culture war,

I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.  

&gt;Our goal is just to talk about the culture war? 

yes. 

Here's the thing too.  We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down.  We used to have email campaigns and shit. 


I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald?   And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been.  They meme and shitpost hard.   We don't.

"7498",679,"KekistaniDiplomat",28,20,678,2,0,"&gt; But we've tried ""no moderation"" weeks before, and memes are like a fucking plague that just sweeps across the entire sub.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"7643",413,"etiolatezed",28,3,205,19,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"7644",694,"saint2e",28,24,413,2,1,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"7645",695,"etiolatezed",28,24,694,16,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"7646",696,"peenoid",28,24,413,-2,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"7647",697,"etiolatezed",28,24,696,2,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"7648",698,"peenoid",28,24,697,-1,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"7649",699,"etiolatezed",28,24,698,2,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading. 

Know the difference between an explanation and an excuse. "

I can very well believe that overall the quality will be better, but at this point the rule change doesn't matter one bit, the fact that the mods didn't respect the community and after that even laughed at the community does.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "
"7657",707,"saint2e",28,24,706,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from... 

I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about."
"7658",708,"ClockworkFool",28,24,707,6,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned. "
"7659",709,"saint2e",28,24,708,2,0,"In looking at AoV's submissions for the past month or so I can definitely see a few of those submissions not making the cut.  Personally speaking, the one about IMC I would've scrolled right by without clicking, that one probably wouldn't have made it, and perhaps rightly so in my estimation.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

The bulk of them all centre around Journalistic Ethics IMHO, and thus would've been fine, I would've thought."

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

If that is the only post, I wouldn't find it objectionable at all. But I think there is more, particularly since there are highly divergent views on what does or doesn't qualify as a given topic.

Which one?  I don't recall this particular venture, though AoV has a laundry list of rule violating here, we've actually gone above and beyond to keep him around.  Of course things have obviously changed within the last few days and the mods aren't going to work too hard to keep him around anymore.  

It's still on him whether he can follow the rules or not though.  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago."
"7662",712,"ClockworkFool",28,24,711,7,0,"&gt;Which one?

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

If people want to start a different sub with different rules that's fine with me as well, just be aware the realities of reddit will eventually kick in. This place isn't ideal for a lot of what we want and there isn't anything we can do about that until it gets a quality competitor with enough resources to do so.

No, as that is moderated by the same people, and they might just spring the same sort of thing on us there. In fact, I pointed this out in basically the only post where I talked about KIA2. Shows that you didn't even read it, that you are extremely poorly informed, despite claiming that you somehow know the truth here.

&gt; /r/KIAChatroom is an alternative as well, and given how they have shown how little they can be trusted by overturning our vote and implementing an option that was voted down 75-1, you never know what can happen at any moment.

Go right ahead and provide the receipts for that. 

The complete timeline is... you're not truthful, as I never said that ""KIA is kill"". I never encouraged anyone to ""abandon"" this place. I only asked for people who wanted to be moderators, that's basically the only time I mentioned my sub here.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

I think the Covington kids 100% deserved to be here.

Honestly, I think I'm more on your side in this than you think.  I'll admit that compared to a few years ago, ""memes"" have definitely evolved.  

I have no idea how you'd define it, but I would not at all be opposed to a rule that allows ""original"" ""memes"".

Smh telling me to link to a deleted comment. A guy was talking about how awful you were and said he was banned so you perma banned him and left  sweet comment. He later clarified that it was a previous incident that he was mistakenly banned by the mods (if you do your job well it shouldnt have happened) that he was referring to, that you assumed he was talking about using an account to evade a ban. You realized that so you deleted your comment while i think your bfs protected you in the comments.

You know something, im a realist and i think this whole clusterfuck will blow over soon, but the people will never forget, and they will never trust you. You and shadist will always be hated here till the end. 

But you, pinker, you will forever be known as the zoe quinn of kia, and i think you know what i mean by that.

You absolutely suck. Good luck with your mental health problems whatever they are this time. "

Yeah, that person was banned wrongly by sciencemile a while back, not by me.

When someone admits to ban-evading, we tend to crack the whip fairly quickly..

When it was determined that the person was wrong in that I **hadn't** banned them, they were unbanned.

Also, I didn't delete the comment. another mod removed it.  It's not deleted.  you can see it on ceddit if you want to go look:

"7936",205,"saint2e",29,1,1,8,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"7937",413,"etiolatezed",29,3,205,19,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"7938",694,"saint2e",29,24,413,3,1,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"7939",695,"etiolatezed",29,24,694,16,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"7940",696,"peenoid",29,24,413,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"7941",697,"etiolatezed",29,24,696,1,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"7942",698,"peenoid",29,24,697,-1,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"7943",699,"etiolatezed",29,24,698,2,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "
"7951",707,"saint2e",29,24,706,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from...

"7952",708,"ClockworkFool",29,24,707,9,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire.

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

"7992",748,"peenoid",29,24,205,2,0,"&gt; Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult. I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

This prompts the question: is there ""better"" content that was being suppressed by the stuff you aren't interested in, or will the self-post change ultimately result in _less_ content overall (and you're just noticing more of the stuff you like although the total volume of it has remained the same)?

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Can you give some specific examples of the stuff you were seeing before vs what's here now? Because as a daily visitor I'm honestly not seeing much of a difference."
"7993",749,"saint2e",29,24,748,2,0,"Yeah time will tell on the ""better content"" or if it's just a coincedence.

And as I said, there's still some stuff on the front page that I ""eye roll and scroll on"", but there seems to be less overall.

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

No, as that is moderated by the same people, and they might just spring the same sort of thing on us there. In fact, I pointed this out in basically the only post where I talked about KIA2. Shows that you didn't even read it, that you are extremely poorly informed, despite claiming that you somehow know the truth here.

&gt; /r/KIAChatroom is an alternative as well, and given how they have shown how little they can be trusted by overturning our vote and implementing an option that was voted down 75-1, you never know what can happen at any moment.

Go right ahead and provide the receipts for that.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

I think the Covington kids 100% deserved to be here. 

I also think a lot of what happened around the Smollet stuff should be here too, but I also think there's some instances where it wouldn't be.

Honestly, I think I'm more on your side in this than you think.  I'll admit that compared to a few years ago, ""memes"" have definitely evolved.  

I have no idea how you'd define it, but I would not at all be opposed to a rule that allows ""original"" ""memes"".   As in, we don't need 20 pictures of el troll, FFFFUUUU or bad luck brian on our front page... but [something like this](https://i.redd.it/d6zid1h6wsg21.jpg)  (just to rip something from the_donald) I actually think is quite funny...

You realized that so you deleted your comment while i think your bfs protected you in the comments.

"8230",205,"saint2e",30,1,1,7,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"8231",413,"etiolatezed",30,3,205,20,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"8232",694,"saint2e",30,24,413,2,1,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"8233",695,"etiolatezed",30,24,694,17,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"8234",696,"peenoid",30,24,413,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"8235",697,"etiolatezed",30,24,696,3,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"8236",698,"peenoid",30,24,697,-1,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"8237",699,"etiolatezed",30,24,698,2,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"8246",708,"ClockworkFool",30,24,707,9,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire.

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Can you give some specific examples of the stuff you were seeing before vs what's here now? Because as a daily visitor I'm honestly not seeing much of a difference."

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

No, as that is moderated by the same people, and they might just spring the same sort of thing on us there. In fact, I pointed this out in basically the only post where I talked about KIA2. Shows that you didn't even read it, that you are extremely poorly informed, despite claiming that you somehow know the truth here.

&gt; /r/KIAChatroom is an alternative as well, and given how they have shown how little they can be trusted by overturning our vote and implementing an option that was voted down 75-1, you never know what can happen at any moment.

"8342",600,"AntonioOfVenice",31,7,9,1,0,"&gt; The complete timeline is Antonio declaring KIA to be kill and encouraging everybody to abandon this place for his subreddit, KIA2.

Go right ahead and provide the receipts for that. 

The complete timeline is... you're not truthful, as I never said that ""KIA is kill"". I never encouraged anyone to ""abandon"" this place. I only asked for people who wanted to be moderators, that's basically the only time I mentioned my sub here.

&gt;  He gained a few subs, nothing really remarkable

I expected 300-400 subs at best. I got 3000. 

&gt; Then the ""We should make antonio a mod here on KIA"" idea started circulated

You do realize that this co-incided with various moderators REEEEEE'ing at me for absolutely no reason, right? I've never wanted to be a moderator here, despite encouragement now and before. I'm not crazy, and the moderators would sooner shut this sub down than give it to me.

I find it funny that you guys place this complete and total faith in upvotes/downvotes.   

Why do you think almost every single larger sub on reddit has rules (that are FAARR more restrictive than ours) about keeping things topical?   It's because people upvote shit.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

"8380",751,"StrawRedditor",31,29,679,2,0,"&gt;So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? 

No, not at all. 

I think the Covington kids 100% deserved to be here. 

I also think a lot of what happened around the Smollet stuff should be here too, but I also think there's some instances where it wouldn't be. 

&gt;The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral.

Honestly, I think I'm more on your side in this than you think.  I'll admit that compared to a few years ago, ""memes"" have definitely evolved.  

I have no idea how you'd define it, but I would not at all be opposed to a rule that allows ""original"" ""memes"".   As in, we don't need 20 pictures of el troll, FFFFUUUU or bad luck brian on our front page... but [something like this](https://i.redd.it/d6zid1h6wsg21.jpg)  (just to rip something from the_donald) I actually think is quite funny... AND, it also easily serves as a start point for discussion (which is generally my biggest criteria for how I judge things... posts that do nothing other than maybe get a cheap chuckle before everyone just moves on are meaningless IMO).

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

I show you two examples of bad behavior. I show you lying about brigading. You deny it despite people being able to find the truth themselves.

Posting a single meme pic of confused black guy when you're making absurd claims that a mod is lying about what's in a link when you say he didn't even click it, but his ""lies"" about the link 100% fit what's inside the link.  How is that even possible?

The Mnemosyne bots auto-archive all posts.  Additionally there's our public modlog as well as ceddit that you can use to back up your claims.

You said ""abusive behavior by mods like pinkerbelle""

You realized that so you deleted your comment while i think your bfs protected you in the comments.

Posts that were linking to articles where the Media failure isn't the highlight(or even in the story), but chooses to focus on MAGA hats and/or Trump, would be removed, as would self-posts that were promoting the fact that the media bias was purely political.

Media political bias isn't ""Media Ethics"" it's just bias.

The failure of the Media to fact-check the incident with the Covington kids, and the failure to vet ""Native Elder and Vietnam Vet"" is ""Media Ethics""

"8524",205,"saint2e",31,1,1,9,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"8525",413,"etiolatezed",31,3,205,20,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"8526",694,"saint2e",31,24,413,1,1,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"8527",695,"etiolatezed",31,24,694,15,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"8528",696,"peenoid",31,24,413,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"8529",697,"etiolatezed",31,24,696,3,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"8530",698,"peenoid",31,24,697,0,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"8531",699,"etiolatezed",31,24,698,2,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"8540",708,"ClockworkFool",31,24,707,8,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

"8556",724,"ClockworkFool",31,24,205,8,0,"&gt;But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions. "
"8557",725,"saint2e",31,24,724,6,0,"And that's basically my disclaimer at the end with the sample size.  ""So far, not so bad"" is essentially my point.  But we'll see if that continues."
"8558",726,"ClockworkFool",31,24,725,2,0,"Things basically more or less going back to normal sure sounds good to me."
"8559",727,"saint2e",31,24,726,2,0,"Yup.  It'd be nice to get away from the YouTuber drama and other tangents, and if that persists, I'd be okay with that."
"8560",728,"Carkudo",31,24,205,7,0,"Except, the reasoning you're providing now is not the same as the reasoning provided by the mods. Not the same as any of them, as they themselves can't seem to settle on any particular reason why they even needed to fuck over the community in the first place, which is a strong indicator that they did so for shit and giggles. That you can rationalize why this measure could potentially somehow be beneficial doesn't really change anything other than expose your bias."
"8561",729,"saint2e",31,24,728,3,1,"All I'm saying is that ""so far, not so bad"", and adding a disclaimer that it's only been a week or so."
"8562",730,"Carkudo",31,24,729,8,0,"Exactly. While people are disturbed that the mod team not only ignored the wishes of the community, but did so smugly and then spent two additional days doing nothing but insulting anyone who disagrees, you pipe up with ""Oh hey, but here's why maybe what they did is beneficial, and maybe that's why they did it!"" Except, it's neither particularly beneficial, nor is it the reason they did it - or they would have said so. You're rationalizing something irrational, and the only thing you achieve by doing so is showing everyone that you're biased in favor of the mod team."
"8563",731,"saint2e",31,24,730,0,1,"Well see if it was the right call in the long run I suppose."
"8564",732,"Carkudo",31,24,731,9,0,"Yes, you've already said that - that's your mantra. First you try to rationalize, then when your bullshit is called out you blank out and start repeating a mantra.  That's the kind of person you are."

There was a vote and mods shit all over it. "
"8579",747,"saint2e",31,24,746,6,0,"I don't usually downvote anything.  I just scroll past.  Lately I've had to do less scrolling (once all the meta posts disappeared, save for this one).  

It's been nice.  That's all I'm saying."
"8580",748,"peenoid",31,24,205,2,0,"&gt; Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult. I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

This prompts the question: is there ""better"" content that was being suppressed by the stuff you aren't interested in, or will the self-post change ultimately result in _less_ content overall (and you're just noticing more of the stuff you like although the total volume of it has remained the same)?

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Can you give some specific examples of the stuff you were seeing before vs what's here now? Because as a daily visitor I'm honestly not seeing much of a difference."
"8581",749,"saint2e",31,24,748,2,0,"Yeah time will tell on the ""better content"" or if it's just a coincedence.

And as I said, there's still some stuff on the front page that I ""eye roll and scroll on"", but there seems to be less overall.

Another moderator had said that no meta threads would be allowed until the next announcement. Now a third moderator is claiming that this is a 'lie' on my part. Unfortunately, this is what happens. They are very bad at co-ordinating and communicating amongst themselves, so when I point out what one of them has said, someone else (who isn't aware of that, doesn't agree, or what not) can accuse me of 'lying'.

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

I think the Covington kids 100% deserved to be here. 

I also think a lot of what happened around the Smollet stuff should be here too, but I also think there's some instances where it wouldn't be.

Honestly, I think I'm more on your side in this than you think.  I'll admit that compared to a few years ago, ""memes"" have definitely evolved.  

I have no idea how you'd define it, but I would not at all be opposed to a rule that allows ""original"" ""memes"".   As in, we don't need 20 pictures of el troll, FFFFUUUU or bad luck brian on our front page... but [something like this](https://i.redd.it/d6zid1h6wsg21.jpg)  (just to rip something from the_donald) I actually think is quite funny...

(They linked images of other subs linking here, but not brigading subs linking here. As in, JordanPeterson sub cross linked here. That's not brigading and has nothing to do with self posts.)


So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

"8818",205,"saint2e",32,1,1,8,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"8819",413,"etiolatezed",32,3,205,18,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"8820",694,"saint2e",32,24,413,2,1,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"8821",695,"etiolatezed",32,24,694,17,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"8822",696,"peenoid",32,24,413,0,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"8823",697,"etiolatezed",32,24,696,2,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"8824",698,"peenoid",32,24,697,-1,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"8825",699,"etiolatezed",32,24,698,2,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible.

"8834",708,"ClockworkFool",32,24,707,11,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned.

Personally speaking, the one about IMC I would've scrolled right by without clicking, that one probably wouldn't have made it, and perhaps rightly so in my estimation.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

The bulk of them all centre around Journalistic Ethics IMHO, and thus would've been fine, I would've thought."

Personally speaking, the one about IMC I would've scrolled right by without clicking, that one probably wouldn't have made it, and perhaps rightly so in my estimation.

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

If that is the only post, I wouldn't find it objectionable at all. But I think there is more, particularly since there are highly divergent views on what does or doesn't qualify as a given topic.

Still, it's all peanuts compared to the way it was done. "
"8837",711,"target_locked",32,24,708,-5,0,"&gt;  and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned. 

Which one?  I don't recall this particular venture, though AoV has a laundry list of rule violating here, we've actually gone above and beyond to keep him around.  Of course things have obviously changed within the last few days and the mods aren't going to work too hard to keep him around anymore.  

It's still on him whether he can follow the rules or not though.  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago."
"8838",712,"ClockworkFool",32,24,711,7,0,"&gt;Which one?

Perhaps you should ask Antonio, or the other mods in your discord if you'd like specifics? It's not my place to get involved any more than I already have. "
"8839",713,"AntonioOfVenice",32,24,711,9,0,"&gt; Which one? I don't recall this particular venture

Was in the modmail, at least the admission. I heard something like: ""I wanted to take action for D&amp;C but after consulting with other mods couldn't."" I don't want to name people, because that might put a target on them.

&gt;  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago.

"8843",717,"saint2e",32,24,716,3,1,"Or perhaps the mods were taking the admittedly bold strategy of doing what they felt would be right in the long run, even if it went against the grain of the subreddit.

Then why did they feel the need to repeatedly change their stated motivation for doing so and to insult members of the community who spoke out against it? I get that you're desperate to defend the mods now, but you're really not thinking this through, so your bullshit is easy to see through. 

Here's a question for you though: *why* are you so desperate to defend them? You're extremely bad at it, only managing to parade your bias for everyone to see, yet you double down and continue to push the same argument that has now been called out as ignoring crucial facts of the matter *twice*. Is it empathy? Do you feel empathy for the mods' power tripping and feel hurt by the attacks on them? You're not even a mod. You have no power to trip on."

"8850",724,"ClockworkFool",32,24,205,9,0,"&gt;But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions. "
"8851",725,"saint2e",32,24,724,3,0,"And that's basically my disclaimer at the end with the sample size.  ""So far, not so bad"" is essentially my point.  But we'll see if that continues."

"8853",727,"saint2e",32,24,726,2,0,"Yup.  It'd be nice to get away from the YouTuber drama and other tangents, and if that persists, I'd be okay with that."
"8854",728,"Carkudo",32,24,205,10,0,"Except, the reasoning you're providing now is not the same as the reasoning provided by the mods. Not the same as any of them, as they themselves can't seem to settle on any particular reason why they even needed to fuck over the community in the first place, which is a strong indicator that they did so for shit and giggles. That you can rationalize why this measure could potentially somehow be beneficial doesn't really change anything other than expose your bias."
"8855",729,"saint2e",32,24,728,1,1,"All I'm saying is that ""so far, not so bad"", and adding a disclaimer that it's only been a week or so."
"8856",730,"Carkudo",32,24,729,6,0,"Exactly. While people are disturbed that the mod team not only ignored the wishes of the community, but did so smugly and then spent two additional days doing nothing but insulting anyone who disagrees, you pipe up with ""Oh hey, but here's why maybe what they did is beneficial, and maybe that's why they did it!"" Except, it's neither particularly beneficial, nor is it the reason they did it - or they would have said so. You're rationalizing something irrational, and the only thing you achieve by doing so is showing everyone that you're biased in favor of the mod team."
"8857",731,"saint2e",32,24,730,1,1,"Well see if it was the right call in the long run I suppose."
"8858",732,"Carkudo",32,24,731,5,0,"Yes, you've already said that - that's your mantra. First you try to rationalize, then when your bullshit is called out you blank out and start repeating a mantra.  That's the kind of person you are."

"8873",747,"saint2e",32,24,746,3,0,"I don't usually downvote anything.  I just scroll past.  Lately I've had to do less scrolling (once all the meta posts disappeared, save for this one).

This prompts the question: is there ""better"" content that was being suppressed by the stuff you aren't interested in, or will the self-post change ultimately result in _less_ content overall (and you're just noticing more of the stuff you like although the total volume of it has remained the same)?

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Can you give some specific examples of the stuff you were seeing before vs what's here now? Because as a daily visitor I'm honestly not seeing much of a difference."

I've been here for no moderation weeks, and obviously because of my position on memes I completely disagree with your point of view. This is just a difference of opinion, but I genuinely wonder which of us is in the minority on this.

I get that people complain about it, but I've always questioned if that was a majority of people or just a majority of mods that hated it.

&gt; I thought this was just a place for GG interested people to discuss GG related stuff.

So, you're kind of admitting you don't want things like the Covington Kids or Jesse Smallette talked about here? I feel like this is where your rules start to agitate a lot of people, because even if I'm interpreting you incorrectly, the rule is vague enough to be (and has been) selectively enforced. 

&gt; Here's the thing too. We've had the sub try taking a more active role in certain things before... and the reddit admins shut us down. We used to have email campaigns and shit.

The great thing about memes is that just the process of creating them and sharing them doesn't count as being ""active role"", but it is. Communities that engage in ""memetic warfare"" develop and iterate on memes like a pressure cooker, until they're so god damn hilarious that they have a capacity for going viral. 

It's basically crowdsourcing a marketing campaign until the message is both hilarious and concise. And even if the meme wasn't ""developed"" here (like, ""It's Okay To Be White""), reddit is at it's heart an aggregation website. So doing things to hamstring aggregation is counter-productive. The reason memes get so overwhelming here is because the community loves them. Suppressing them is why there's several 1-2 day old posts on KiA's frontpage; This place is stagnate.

Think about the NPC meme for example. That was born of a post about Simulation Theory and how an anon thought most people he interacted with weren't even real. Reiterate that idea 1000x and suddenly you have a scathing criticism of SJW-culture. We used to do that. You guys have a Vivian James banner with sockpuppets and sealions, which are memes, while unironically banning memes. It's... weird.

&gt; I guess the question is, do we want this sub to turn into the_donald? And don't get me wrong, I go to the_donald a ton... and a sub like that has it's place... but I think it's pretty distinctly different than what KiA has always been. They meme and shitpost hard. We don't.

I guess I just wish we took their approach then. There's things they've come up with that I'm pretty sure ended up on tweets that have had a *national impact*. I'm not sure when KiA gave up on effecting change, but I guess I'm glad I wasn't here to see KiA lose their fangs."

I think the Covington kids 100% deserved to be here. 

I also think a lot of what happened around the Smollet stuff should be here too, but I also think there's some instances where it wouldn't be.

Honestly, I think I'm more on your side in this than you think.  I'll admit that compared to a few years ago, ""memes"" have definitely evolved.  

I have no idea how you'd define it, but I would not at all be opposed to a rule that allows ""original"" ""memes"".   As in, we don't need 20 pictures of el troll, FFFFUUUU or bad luck brian on our front page... but [something like this](https://i.redd.it/d6zid1h6wsg21.jpg)  (just to rip something from the_donald) I actually think is quite funny...

So the real reason is that the mods have been behaving this way for awhile and most people hadn't noticed it. I ran into it three months ago. THe mods removed a thread that was a link to an article that discussed gamergate and other relevant topics to the sub. I was sent to modmail, which was a deadend. So I complained about it.

The mods, in a private discord, then urged former mods to attack me:

"9112",205,"saint2e",33,1,1,8,1,"Disclaimer: I'm a former mod here.

I'm going to disagree with you, for now.  Let me explain:

Before all the Mod Drama, I'd check in here and there, and finding content that I enjoyed was difficult.  I didn't want to spend too much time exposing the hypocrisy of YouTubers, but I did find links/discussions that were interesting to me.

I joined in on the meta posts because I like to make jokes so I made a metamegathread or megametathread because that was a sticking point when I was mod.

But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid.  Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.  

Now, that said, it's only been a week, but I'm keenly interested to see how KiAPrime and it's offshoots do over the next 6 months.  I'm a big fan of ""fine, I'll go make my own &lt;insert thing&gt;.  With blackjack, and hookers"" approach when you don't like what something has become.  

Essentially let the free market decide.  Now, obviously KiAPrime has a leg up with being an established sub, but if enough people are up in arms, then I'll be interested to see a) where they land and b) what happens to KiAPrime in the meantime.

So far, I feel like the quality has gone up here, with a very small sample size, to be fair."
"9113",413,"etiolatezed",33,3,205,21,0,"&gt; Essentially let the free market decide. 

That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. The mods keep tweaking and adding rules so they can pretend they have a reason to ignore the community. And when the community loudly rejects a rule, they put it in anyways. 

"
"9114",694,"saint2e",33,24,413,1,1,"So now the market, aka users, can spend their karma dollars elsewhere if that other place can provide them the service they want.  "
"9115",695,"etiolatezed",33,24,694,14,0,"Sure, but I am just perplexed why you would argue that and ignore that the mods here are against any ""market decides"" idea. Naturally, the mods here will try to dissuade such a thing from happening. 

"
"9116",696,"peenoid",33,24,413,-3,1,"&gt; That's the opposite of what the mods have been doing. The market decides it likes a thread. The mods remove the thread. 

I agree with you, HOWEVER, here's the problem with this reasoning: a subreddit's content isn't exactly like a market commodity, and a subreddit isn't exactly like a market. A subreddit is more like a specific shelf in a grocery store. If you go to the cereal aisle to buy some Cocoa Puffs, you expect to see cereal stocked there. If instead they've stocked hot sauce, you're going to be pretty annoyed that you can't get your Cocoa Puffs. If you went and asked the manager and he told you ""well, people wanted hot sauce to be there instead, so that's what we stocked,"" you'd probably tell him he's an idiot.

In the minds of many people, KiA is labelled as a certain shelf in the store, but other stuff is ending up on that shelf instead of what they expect. Whether or not we agree with the specific line being drawn by the mods, the line _does_ have to be drawn _somewhere_. This dispute ultimately comes down to a disagreement over what KiA is ""about,"" and until that's resolved then this tension will always exist and will continue to be a point of contention, especially between the mods and the rest of the userbase.

So.. what is KiA about?"
"9117",697,"etiolatezed",33,24,696,2,0,"First, it's not like a grocery store shelf at all. The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics and customers can come in to complain if things are out of place. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.) So you aren't just customer, but worker and you have been supplying ""the shelves"" the whole time. Your analogy misunderstands the way reddit and social media works. Curation was never needed. The curation is the community. 

KiA is about gamergate, but GG was part of something that's grown far bigger than just the antics of Polygon and Kotaku. This is because those antics are part of a larger issue. So maybe other topics and issues intersect. You could talk about dishonest reporting, but there are **reasons** the dishonest reporting keeps happening. There's patterns, playbooks and a great deal of predictability. You can't understand KiA unless you understand what gets coined SJW, the campus issues that teach the ideology, the way the press (overall) has changed and no longer serves the people, the way HR and diversity training is run, the overall social racketeering scam that is run, and so on. 

So because KiA is born of gamergate then it's about all the things that caused GG. If people can't understand that then they shouldn't be joining in the conversation at this point. We're far past that debate. "
"9118",698,"peenoid",33,24,697,-1,1,"&gt; The very nature of reddit is not one where reddit workers supply the topics. The nature of reddit is that the public supplies the topics, the discussion and about everything that reddit profits off of. (You're all doing free labor. Not just the mods. All of us.)

Then the original analogy between reddit and a free market makes even less sense.

And your statement isn't true. We don't engage in free labor. There is an exchange. ""Free labor"" implies we get nothing in return for time and effort spent, but we do. We set a ""price"" on our effort by deciding whether or not we will engage with the subreddit (upvoting, commenting, posting), and if we don't get back what we put in, we are free to disengage.

The problem with the comparison between a free market and reddit isn't necessarily with the _mechanics_, but with the fact that the market in question (this subreddit) ceases to function the way it was intended to if not regulated. That regulation does include restricting the types of ""goods sold"" (posts) that people want to ""buy"" (engage with by upvoting and commenting). We can allow this subreddit to become something entirely different than what it is ""supposed"" to be at some risk of it eventually falling apart. The mods appear to be anticipating this and proactively trying to prevent it. I'm not saying they're _right_ or even that I agree with their actions (I don't), but they do have a point."
"9119",699,"etiolatezed",33,24,698,2,0,"We aren't setting the price. Reddit makes money off of our discussion. So our discussion is labor for profit for which we're not paid. The price is set outside ourselves. 

We can have discussions at a bar, at a park, or at a diner. The bar makes money off of things other than discussion. The park makes no money. The diner makes money off of things other than discussion. To call conversation an exchange of labor is one twisted and fucked up way of viewing things. 

The mods arguments have to have merit. They do not. They only act as cover for what they're about: increasing moderation power. 

See, the mod argument now is they are protecting against brigading. (Which they haven't been able to prove.) It's not that they  are regulators of discussion. Hell, your explanation is probably more honest but the community would hate that. So they're trying to spin it as protection against brigading.

Point being, being a mod doesn't mean you take care of the sub for yourself, but for the whole community. And part of that means listening to the community, taking the 1% option that only had 2 votes is the polar opposite of that.

I can very well believe that overall the quality will be better, but at this point the rule change doesn't matter one bit, the fact that the mods didn't respect the community and after that even laughed at the community does.

I keep hearing this sentiment that AoV will leave and go try to form his own kingdom with hookers and blow, that he was only involved as part of a four year plan to kill KiA and it keeps coming from mods, past and present. 

It just makes me wonder if any of you guys actually read *what he says*. No offence, but it genuinely does. 

There's room to argue that the initially proposed options in the poll from a few months ago were *designed* to get rid of him, because supposedly a mod implied as much. If the initial ""incorrect"" version of the rule change had stood, it would have directly gotten rid of most of his content, effectively exiling him by default. But every step of the way, even while he was being particularly critical of the mods and what they were *apparently* pushing for, I've not once seen him suggest he would abandon KiA and he's quite vocally advocating the opposite, to stay and try and be a positive for KiA however possible. "
"9127",707,"saint2e",33,24,706,3,0,"I have no qualms with AoV at all, in fact I think he brings a lot to the table, so I'm not sure where this sentiment that he was driven out by the new rule comes from... 

I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about."
"9128",708,"ClockworkFool",33,24,707,11,0,"&gt;I've always found most of his stuff on topic with the core things KiA claims to be about.

Sure. But the original poll had at least one option that was broadly in line with the ""incorrect"" version that got posted a few days ago. Both would have had the effect of removing *any* Selfpost not directly dealing with Gaming/Nerd Culture, Journalistic Ethics or *Acts of* Censorship. No ifs, no buts. A mod at the time pointed out (if I recall correctly) that most of those options would have the effect of removing a lot of what Antonio posted and Antonio himself agrees with that interpretation. 

It's an open secret that a lot of the mod team have problems with him, to the point where I distinctly remember a mod comment from ages ago that numerous mods were officially recused from ruling on him (could be wrong on this, I'm not the best at specifics but I'm sure that was the case) and at least one mod has admitted to lobbying to get him full on banned. "
"9129",709,"saint2e",33,24,708,3,0,"In looking at AoV's submissions for the past month or so I can definitely see a few of those submissions not making the cut.  Personally speaking, the one about IMC I would've scrolled right by without clicking, that one probably wouldn't have made it, and perhaps rightly so in my estimation.

I do see a few that I would've personally be interested in, but probably wouldn't have made the cut.  The Megan Kelly Hall one, and the one about the actor from Empire supposedly being assaulted.

I'll say the ""fake hate crime"" themed one probably isn't really KiA core topic, but I feel like the Megan Kelly Hall one probably would've been a good one to have with all the other Covington shenanigans going on.

The bulk of them all centre around Journalistic Ethics IMHO, and thus would've been fine, I would've thought."

Just for the record, I only posted that because the sub was inundated with Jim fanboys who were just presenting one side of the story, and accusing the sub and the moderators of being biased in favor of IMC - when people were just opposing 'listen and believe', mindless drama and other nonsense.

If that is the only post, I wouldn't find it objectionable at all. But I think there is more, particularly since there are highly divergent views on what does or doesn't qualify as a given topic.

Still, it's all peanuts compared to the way it was done. "

Which one?  I don't recall this particular venture, though AoV has a laundry list of rule violating here, we've actually gone above and beyond to keep him around.  Of course things have obviously changed within the last few days and the mods aren't going to work too hard to keep him around anymore.  

It's still on him whether he can follow the rules or not though.  If he'll allow me too I'll gladly show you his note history to give a reasonable idea of how many run ins he's had that would have led a normal user to a perma ages ago."
"9132",712,"ClockworkFool",33,24,711,8,0,"&gt;Which one?

"9133",713,"AntonioOfVenice",33,24,711,7,0,"&gt; Which one? I don't recall this particular venture

Was in the modmail, at least the admission. I heard something like: ""I wanted to take action for D&amp;C but after consulting with other mods couldn't."" I don't want to name people, because that might put a target on them.

Then why did they feel the need to repeatedly change their stated motivation for doing so and to insult members of the community who spoke out against it? I get that you're desperate to defend the mods now, but you're really not thinking this through, so your bullshit is easy to see through. 

Here's a question for you though: *why* are you so desperate to defend them? You're extremely bad at it, only managing to parade your bias for everyone to see, yet you double down and continue to push the same argument that has now been called out as ignoring crucial facts of the matter *twice*.

KiA Prime has been basically unusable for days while it was on fire. What you're seeing is the good content from those days all kind of backed up and condensed down into one day posting, along with probably some degree of extra commenting because people are relieved that things have even *slightly* gone back to normal. 

Any appearance of a change in content will just be down to the dynamics of what just happened and will almost certainly even back out over the next few days. 

Plus to be fair, for some reason we've had not one but two topics that the sub was spammed with in the week or so before this clusterfuck that were allowed to run riot despite the existence of rules banning reposts and threads that lack any significant new developments, so the apparent quality was rather artificially surpressed in the time leading up to recent events, just to further mess with your perceptions.

&gt; But I've been coming back daily now to see how things shake out and quite frankly once the meta posts were off the front page, the content has been pretty solid. Sure, there's been a few threads that I kinda rolled my eyes at, but much less than before.

Sub gets under 2k monthly traffic. Total sub count means very little, could be mostly dead accounts for all we know. 

Edit: number is different, apparently. I'm trying to find my source for the above."
"9185",626,"telios87",33,10,509,3,0,"We get surges from mainstream media events, so lots of signups but very few who actually engage.

Those surges are also used to insert socks for later ""I've been here for X months/years"" use. "
"9186",627,"ShadistsReddit",33,10,626,-2,1,"Eh, most don't even do that... they just throw out vague ""I can't log into my old account that's been here from the start because reasons""."
"9187",628,"HandofBane",33,10,509,-1,0,"&gt; Sub gets under 2k monthly traffic. 

Trying to figure out where you are getting this number from.  Even in the main meta thread, it was stated by a couple mods the sub still sees 30k unique *daily* visitors, and before I stepped down, that was fairly consistent (somewhere around 300-350k uniques per month, IIRC).  The traffic page was hidden from public view by the admins, not the mods, and it doesn't take much effort to ask the mods what current traffic looks like - some mods actually like sharing that info."
"9188",629,"will99222",33,10,628,1,0,"I recall seeing a mod state ~2k unique visitors buried in replies of one of the many meta threads over the past few days. 

I'll try and dig it up but that isn't easy on my phone between deliveries while trying not to lose a finger from riding a moped without gloves, and reedits ""search"" tool isn't any help either.

I guess I'll concede being misinformed here, and if I can't find it by the end of the night, I'll take the blame for it too. "
"9189",630,"HandofBane",33,10,629,-2,0,"I don't fault anyone for having a hard time digging through the thousands of meta thread replies over the last few days.  [This is what I got that specifically refers to unique visitor counts](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/aqcxru/selfpost_clarification_and_discussion/egf5nv9/), if there was something else, I didn't see it, though there are a ton of chains that go dozens of comments deep I didn't check.

**Edit**: offhand what the 2k thing *might* refer to is that the number of active users at any given time rarely goes over 2k?  I don't think it has done so often since the david drama, and that was heavily caused by all the meta drama subs brigading over the course of it."
