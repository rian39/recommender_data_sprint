Gamers do not believe in identity politics and are meritocratic -- and thus, gamers are fairly immune to Identity Marxism.  To wit:  We don't give someone bonus loot in our MMORPGs because they have a cunt.  We only care if they can hold aggro.  Thus, in order to push Identity Marxism in gaming -- which is important, because Gaming is now far more likely to indoctrinate children now than Hollywood -- the Gamer Identity must be disrupted and replaced with a subverted, controlled one.

""Gamers"" have to die so ""Genuine Imitation Soy Gamer Identity Product"" can replace them.

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

There were maybe five people in the West who knew Fire Emblem existed before Smash. I mean by the time they got their hands on it Fire Emblem had already stayed terribly from its respectable origins, but an obscure SRPG is still a really weird thing to suddenly get big on Tumblr. Like... do they watch lets plays or what? I find it hard to imagine obese Tumblr legbeards playing even the easiest of the Nu-Emblems themselves.

Why Fire Emblem and not something else that has an extensive cast with lots of little character interactions for shipping (I'm assuming that's the main appeal for these... things... right? Correct me if I'm wrong, I can't put myself in the shoes of these pod people at all)? Is it just that they had the Wii/DS already and bought a game because of Smash?

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

There were maybe five people in the West who knew Fire Emblem existed before Smash. I mean by the time they got their hands on it Fire Emblem had already stayed terribly from its respectable origins, but an obscure SRPG is still a really weird thing to suddenly get big on Tumblr. Like... do they watch lets plays or what? I find it hard to imagine obese Tumblr legbeards playing even the easiest of the Nu-Emblems themselves.

Why Fire Emblem and not something else that has an extensive cast with lots of little character interactions for shipping (I'm assuming that's the main appeal for these... things... right? Correct me if I'm wrong, I can't put myself in the shoes of these pod people at all)? Is it just that they had the Wii/DS already and bought a game because of Smash?

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

Gamers do not believe in identity politics and are meritocratic -- and thus, gamers are fairly immune to Identity Marxism.  To wit:  We don't give someone bonus loot in our MMORPGs because they have a cunt.  We only care if they can hold aggro.  Thus, in order to push Identity Marxism in gaming -- which is important, because Gaming is now far more likely to indoctrinate children now than Hollywood -- the Gamer Identity must be disrupted and replaced with a subverted, controlled one.

""Gamers"" have to die so ""Genuine Imitation Soy Gamer Identity Product"" can replace them.

Thus, in order to push Identity Marxism in gaming -- which is important, because Gaming is now far more likely to indoctrinate children now than Hollywood -- the Gamer Identity must be disrupted and replaced with a subverted, controlled one.

""Gamers"" have to die so ""Genuine Imitation Soy Gamer Identity Product"" can replace them.

Sargon covered this in some of his earliest videos, a little over 3 years ago, the ""Why Gamers Had To Die"" series:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF5a5IgbuYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF5a5IgbuYk) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOt-YZ\_i0Fk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOt-YZ_i0Fk)

"1006",38,"ggthxnore",19,1,1,2,0,"The Fire Emblem thing is weird. Nintendo has universal appeal, sure, but that's when you're talking about Mario and Pokemon and Zelda and Kirby and such. There were maybe five people in the West who knew Fire Emblem existed before Smash. I mean by the time they got their hands on it Fire Emblem had already stayed terribly from its respectable origins, but an obscure SRPG is still a really weird thing to suddenly get big on Tumblr. Like... do they watch lets plays or what? I find it hard to imagine obese Tumblr legbeards playing even the easiest of the Nu-Emblems themselves.

Why Fire Emblem and not something else that has an extensive cast with lots of little character interactions for shipping (I'm assuming that's the main appeal for these... things... right? Correct me if I'm wrong, I can't put myself in the shoes of these pod people at all)? Is it just that they had the Wii/DS already and bought a game because of Smash?

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

This is one of the reasons GamerGate was sparked off.  The **Gamers Are Dead** articles were sparked by Adrienne Shaw, an Identity Marxist ""academic"" who blatantly spelled it out in her ""research.""

Gamers do not believe in identity politics and are meritocratic -- and thus, gamers are fairly immune to Identity Marxism.  To wit:  We don't give someone bonus loot in our MMORPGs because they have a cunt.  We only care if they can hold aggro.  Thus, in order to push Identity Marxism in gaming -- which is important, because Gaming is now far more likely to indoctrinate children now than Hollywood -- the Gamer Identity must be disrupted and replaced with a subverted, controlled one.

""Gamers"" have to die so ""Genuine Imitation Soy Gamer Identity Product"" can replace them.

Sargon covered this in some of his earliest videos, a little over 3 years ago, the ""Why Gamers Had To Die"" series:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF5a5IgbuYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF5a5IgbuYk) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOt-YZ\_i0Fk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOt-YZ_i0Fk)

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

This is one of the reasons GamerGate was sparked off.  The **Gamers Are Dead** articles were sparked by Adrienne Shaw, an Identity Marxist ""academic"" who blatantly spelled it out in her ""research.""

Gamers do not believe in identity politics and are meritocratic -- and thus, gamers are fairly immune to Identity Marxism.  To wit:  We don't give someone bonus loot in our MMORPGs because they have a cunt.  We only care if they can hold aggro.  Thus, in order to push Identity Marxism in gaming -- which is important, because Gaming is now far more likely to indoctrinate children now than Hollywood -- the Gamer Identity must be disrupted and replaced with a subverted, controlled one.

""Gamers"" have to die so ""Genuine Imitation Soy Gamer Identity Product"" can replace them.

Sargon covered this in some of his earliest videos, a little over 3 years ago, the ""Why Gamers Had To Die"" series:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF5a5IgbuYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF5a5IgbuYk) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOt-YZ\_i0Fk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOt-YZ_i0Fk)

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

"1556",65,"ggthxnore",27,8,1,1,0,"The Fire Emblem thing is weird. Nintendo has universal appeal, sure, but that's when you're talking about Mario and Pokemon and Zelda and Kirby and such. There were maybe five people in the West who knew Fire Emblem existed before Smash. I mean by the time they got their hands on it Fire Emblem had already stayed terribly from its respectable origins, but an obscure SRPG is still a really weird thing to suddenly get big on Tumblr. Like... do they watch lets plays or what? I find it hard to imagine obese Tumblr legbeards playing even the easiest of the Nu-Emblems themselves.

Why Fire Emblem and not something else that has an extensive cast with lots of little character interactions for shipping (I'm assuming that's the main appeal for these... things... right? Correct me if I'm wrong, I can't put myself in the shoes of these pod people at all)? Is it just that they had the Wii/DS already and bought a game because of Smash? 

I would be genuinely interested if there's a YouTube video out there somewhere documenting the origins of this inexplicable FE fandom. Of all the things to get infiltrated, ""obscure niche Japanese SRPGs"" would've been way down on my list of predictions."

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

This is one of the reasons GamerGate was sparked off.  The **Gamers Are Dead** articles were sparked by Adrienne Shaw, an Identity Marxist ""academic"" who blatantly spelled it out in her ""research.""

Gamers do not believe in identity politics and are meritocratic -- and thus, gamers are fairly immune to Identity Marxism.  To wit:  We don't give someone bonus loot in our MMORPGs because they have a cunt.  We only care if they can hold aggro.  Thus, in order to push Identity Marxism in gaming -- which is important, because Gaming is now far more likely to indoctrinate children now than Hollywood -- the Gamer Identity must be disrupted and replaced with a subverted, controlled one.

""Gamers"" have to die so ""Genuine Imitation Soy Gamer Identity Product"" can replace them.

Sargon covered this in some of his earliest videos, a little over 3 years ago, the ""Why Gamers Had To Die"" series:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF5a5IgbuYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF5a5IgbuYk) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOt-YZ\_i0Fk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOt-YZ_i0Fk)

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

Like... do they watch lets plays or what? I find it hard to imagine obese Tumblr legbeards playing even the easiest of the Nu-Emblems themselves.

Why Fire Emblem and not something else that has an extensive cast with lots of little character interactions for shipping (I'm assuming that's the main appeal for these... things... right? Correct me if I'm wrong, I can't put myself in the shoes of these pod people at all)? Is it just that they had the Wii/DS already and bought a game because of Smash?

That way, instead of generations of dissenters with common sense, like they have to put up with now, they'll end up with a generation who even as adults are too confused, alienated, miserable and emotionally crippled to offer up any meaningful resistence."

They don't give a shit about policing what their child sees. All this deplatforming shit and censorship and calls for X to resign are always perpetuate by the left. The people on the right don't really give a shit what you do AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T AFFECT OTHERS.

Sometimes the right may get things wrong, but at least their children aren't growing up to be sheltered little snowflakes that demands society conform to them. They have no problems calling shit as they see it, and this type of brutal honesty is lost in the left. Everything is a fucking subversive game in the left where you are ""in the group"" one second and out the next if it fits their agenda.

Can't even play a fucking game without some fucknut complaining ""omg you're OBJECTIFYING WOMEN."" I also love how SJWs have no qualms slandering every Christian person and ignoring freedom of religion, which is a FUCKING RIGHT in this country."

not always. these things go in cycles. this cycle it is the left's authoritarians being the douches,  last cycle it was the rights. the authoritarians will keep pushing and pushing until the public have had enough and then the they will scurry away, leaving their useful idiots to take the fall.

&gt;people on the right don't really give a shit what you do AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T AFFECT OTHERS.

that's a liberal position, not one exclusive to the right.  

&gt;Sometimes the right may get things wrong, but at least their children aren't growing up to be sheltered little snowflakes that demands society conform to them.

this may apply to your particular brand of right wing ideology, it's not something which applies universally to the right.

&gt; Everything is a fucking subversive game in the left where you are ""in the group"" one second and out the next if it fits their agenda. 

this may apply to some groups on the left , but not all. it can also apply to some right wing groups.

There's your answer, Nintendo is the family friendly company. This means it's more willing to bend under pressure if a stink is given about something. That's also one of the reasons people hated when Nintendo started to bring on things such as Bayonetta and other 'less' kid friendly titles. Because a company that starts to diversify themselves to be less exclusively ""kid friendly"" then causes regressives to begin to lose that influence because they are intentionally seeking a larger, more mature, and often less than PC group. Fire Emblem may not be the most mature game when compared to Bayonetta or Senran Kagura, but it's a step in that direction and the regressives are terrified because the best they can hope to do is embed themselves deep and pray they stop which will only happen if people stop showing interest or the market for said games implodes."

Also there's a weird trend where people seem to think pretending they like Nintendo only gives them more gamer cred and differentiates them from the whole ""Evil toxic gamer bros"". Plus Nintendo is an easily known name so SJWs not into gaming likely still know about it."
"1842",80,"ggthxnore",31,12,1,1,0,"The Fire Emblem thing is weird. Nintendo has universal appeal, sure, but that's when you're talking about Mario and Pokemon and Zelda and Kirby and such. There were maybe five people in the West who knew Fire Emblem existed before Smash. I mean by the time they got their hands on it Fire Emblem had already stayed terribly from its respectable origins, but an obscure SRPG is still a really weird thing to suddenly get big on Tumblr. Like... do they watch lets plays or what? I find it hard to imagine obese Tumblr legbeards playing even the easiest of the Nu-Emblems themselves.

Why Fire Emblem and not something else that has an extensive cast with lots of little character interactions for shipping (I'm assuming that's the main appeal for these... things... right? Correct me if I'm wrong, I can't put myself in the shoes of these pod people at all)? Is it just that they had the Wii/DS already and bought a game because of Smash? 

I would be genuinely interested if there's a YouTube video out there somewhere documenting the origins of this inexplicable FE fandom. Of all the things to get infiltrated, ""obscure niche Japanese SRPGs"" would've been way down on my list of predictions."
