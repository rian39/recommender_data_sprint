Also, I wonder if that guy even read what it says on that linked page:

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;Frank Herbert wanted a harsh-sounding name for the antagonists of his novel, Dune.

"27",27,"md1957",1,1,1,7,0,"Granted, the article is five days old as of this post. But looks like the *Escapist* just couldn't resist doubling down. All while pissing over Frank Herbert's work and legacy:

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

All that stuff about ""Male and Female vision"" and knowing the ways of the desert and all the events of the novel, PSHAW!

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"", but they will immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

Don't believe me? Browse this dude's article history. Tons of blatant propaganda.

The Atreides family's chief of intelligence is called Thufir Hawat. Paul's son is explicitly said to have the ancestral memories of multiple middle-eastern rulers, in particular the Caliph Harun al-Rashid. The Bene Tleilax, another of the galaxy's great forces, are organised around a religion called the [Islamiyat](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Islamiyat).

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"", but they will immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;Frank Herbert wanted a harsh-sounding name for the antagonists of his novel, Dune.

"129",27,"md1957",3,1,1,9,0,"Granted, the article is five days old as of this post. But looks like the *Escapist* just couldn't resist doubling down. All while pissing over Frank Herbert's work and legacy:

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;Frank Herbert wanted a harsh-sounding name for the antagonists of his novel, Dune.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"", but they will immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

Don't believe me? Browse this dude's article history. Tons of blatant propaganda.

"197",56,"bvert",4,2,31,10,0,"&gt; A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. 

I mean, there's a reason /pol/ had so many memes about ""anti-white"" journalists/activists actually being jewish.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;Frank Herbert wanted a harsh-sounding name for the antagonists of his novel, Dune.

"266",27,"md1957",5,1,1,15,0,"Granted, the article is five days old as of this post. But looks like the *Escapist* just couldn't resist doubling down. All while pissing over Frank Herbert's work and legacy:

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"", but they will immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

Except that if you read the book you find out that the Bene Gesserit didn't plan on Paul being the 'Chosen One.'  His mother was supposed to produce a female offspring to mate to the Harkonnen line, finishing out their project and ending the squabble between the Harkonnens and Atreides to protect both blood lines.  Paul's mother falls in love with Paul's father (she's not supposed to do that) and gives him a son as an heir to make him happy.  The hardship Paul experiences on Arrakis after the Emperor betrays his family and allows the Harkonens to attack them and the spice are what triggers Paul's transformation into the planned super-man.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;Frank Herbert wanted a harsh-sounding name for the antagonists of his novel, Dune.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"", but they will immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

Don't believe me? Browse this dude's article history. Tons of blatant propaganda.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"", but they will immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

Don't believe me? Browse this dude's article history. Tons of blatant propaganda.

He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"", but they will immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

Don't believe me? Browse this dude's article history. Tons of blatant propaganda.

He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"", but they will immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"", but they will immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

Don't believe me? Browse this dude's article history. Tons of blatant propaganda.

These didn't grow in a vacuum, but in response to that kind of articles getting more numerous and blatant during the 2016 campaigns.

He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"", but they will immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"", but they will immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness.

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

Don't believe me? Browse this dude's article history. Tons of blatant propaganda.

Paul's mother falls in love with Paul's father (she's not supposed to do that) and gives him a son as an heir to make him happy.  The hardship Paul experiences on Arrakis after the Emperor betrays his family and allows the Harkonens to attack them and the spice are what triggers Paul's transformation into the planned super-man.

He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

Don't believe me? Browse this dude's article history. Tons of blatant propaganda.

I mean, there's a reason /pol/ had so many memes about ""anti-white"" journalists/activists actually being jewish.

These didn't grow in a vacuum, but in response to that kind of articles getting more numerous and blatant during the 2016 campaigns.  

And naturally, the radicals only doubled down after Trump's election, with slogans like ""This jew will replace you"", and forward.com adding ""When it comes to Americas class hierarchy, we replaced you and your kind long ago.""

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

Paul's mother falls in love with Paul's father (she's not supposed to do that) and gives him a son as an heir to make him happy.  The hardship Paul experiences on Arrakis after the Emperor betrays his family and allows the Harkonens to attack them and the spice are what triggers Paul's transformation into the planned super-man.

He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

Don't believe me? Browse this dude's article history. Tons of blatant propaganda.

I mean, there's a reason /pol/ had so many memes about ""anti-white"" journalists/activists actually being jewish.

These didn't grow in a vacuum, but in response to that kind of articles getting more numerous and blatant during the 2016 campaigns.  

And naturally, the radicals only doubled down after Trump's election, with slogans like ""This jew will replace you"", and forward.com adding ""When it comes to Americas class hierarchy, we replaced you and your kind long ago.""

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen.

He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

If I were to, for example, suggest that ""many black people use identity politics for their own gain,"" would *that* be considered ""engaging in identity politics""? 

Broadly speaking, does *noticing when members of certain ethnic groups cynically and self-servingly deploy identity politics* constitute *engaging in* identity politics?

Except that if you read the book you find out that the Bene Gesserit didn't plan on Paul being the 'Chosen One.'  His mother was supposed to produce a female offspring to mate to the Harkonnen line, finishing out their project and ending the squabble between the Harkonnens and Atreides to protect both blood lines.  Paul's mother falls in love with Paul's father (she's not supposed to do that) and gives him a son as an heir to make him happy.  The hardship Paul experiences on Arrakis after the Emperor betrays his family and allows the Harkonens to attack them and the spice are what triggers Paul's transformation into the planned super-man.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

Don't believe me? Browse this dude's article history. Tons of blatant propaganda.

These didn't grow in a vacuum, but in response to that kind of articles getting more numerous and blatant during the 2016 campaigns.

I have some disagreements with the statement made by /u/throwawaycuzmeh, but from my reading of it, the statement was critiquing *an alleged pattern of Jewish people engaging in identity politics*. 

If I were to, for example, suggest that ""many black people use identity politics for their own gain,"" would *that* be considered ""engaging in identity politics""? 

Broadly speaking, does *noticing when members of certain ethnic groups cynically and self-servingly deploy identity politics* constitute *engaging in* identity politics?

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

I have some disagreements with the statement made by /u/throwawaycuzmeh, but from my reading of it, the statement was critiquing *an alleged pattern of Jewish people engaging in identity politics*. 

If I were to, for example, suggest that ""many black people use identity politics for their own gain,"" would *that* be considered ""engaging in identity politics""? 

Broadly speaking, does *noticing when members of certain ethnic groups cynically and self-servingly deploy identity politics* constitute *engaging in* identity politics?

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

If I were to, for example, suggest that ""many black people use identity politics for their own gain,"" would *that* be considered ""engaging in identity politics""?

But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen.

He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

&gt;Dune has Paul Atreides who is born from the waterworld Caladan, son of a duke, trained by the best swordsmen and tacticians in the galaxy and trained as a Mentat human computer. He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name. He hates it but couldn't do anything about it because it's part of his destiny most especially that his Fremen concubine dies of giving birth to his twins.

But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Not to mention the author using it to prop up Tasha Suris book *Empire of Sand* as if it's an enlightened rebuttal to Dune. "

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

If I were to, for example, suggest that ""many black people use identity politics for their own gain,"" would *that* be considered ""engaging in identity politics""? 

Broadly speaking, does *noticing when members of certain ethnic groups cynically and self-servingly deploy identity politics* constitute *engaging in* identity politics?

He and his pregnant mother went into hiding from their enemies, the Harkonnens, who killed his father, and met the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, who also hate the Harkonnen. They managed to won the favor of the Fremen, learned their culture and Paul fell in love with a Fremen girl (But she's not a full-blooded Fremen because her grandfather is a former Planetologist of the Emperor who went native). He's also destined to be the Messiah which the Fremen had been waiting for due to his prophetic powers (though this is just part of the Bene Gesserit's machinations) and at the end of the novel, he led the Fremen against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and took over the throne by marrying the Emperor's eldest daughter while keeping his Freman lover as his concubine. But the sequel, Dune Messiah deconstructed this where Paul turned out to be a tyrant who just unleashed his diehard followers into the entire galaxy, causing chaos and destruction in his name.

&gt;The Mighty Whitey trope suggests that a white person dumped among less white people will automatically become a king and a god. But in *Dune*, as in other Mighty Whitey stories, theres a bit more going on. Pauls whiteness makes him an object of worship for the Fremen. But his time with them also gives him access to his full prophetic abilities, ultimately allowing him to defeat the Emperor and become the effective ruler of the universe. Similarly, Tarzan is tougher and stronger than other European whites and Iron Fist has powers denied to most white people. Whitey is mighty not just in contrast to people of color, but because of his affinity for people of color.  
&gt;  
&gt;This makes sense if you see Mighty Whiteys might as a metaphor for imperialism. White people grow wealthy and powerful by subjugating other peoples and extracting their resources.  
&gt;  
&gt;In *Dune*, the Arrakis desert contains a loose oil analogue called spice. Spice powers spaceships rather than cars or factories. The spice is a drug which sparks telepathic and precognitive abilities and pilots must take it to steer from planet to planet. The Fremen have been made into super fighters by the harsh conditions of Arrakis. Paul takes the spice to become a prophet, and capitalizes on the misery of the Fremen when they become his warriors and sweep away all before them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pauls divinity and power comes from his ability to capitalize on the resources and pain of others. On the surface, Mighty Whitey characters are superior because of their whiteness. But dig a little deeper, and their powers are borrowed or, more accurately, stolen. They are godlike because theyve appropriated the labor and wealth of others. Paul claims to be wracked with guilt because he sees a future in which he leads the Fremen in a path of bloody destruction across the universe. But really the guilt is for his present glory, built on blood and a deceit that the story wont, and cant, quite acknowledge.

Of course.

For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, allow me to catch you up.

Everything that this writer is attributing to ""whiteness"" can more accurately be attributed to wealth. His attempt to establish whiteness as a proxy for wealth is a misdirect. The wealthiest demographic in the world is actually *Jewish*, but Jewish people cannot be targeted for criticism because the Holocaust happened.

A great many of the white leftist influencers and thought leaders who proclaim the evil of whiteness are, in fact, Jewish. They will denigrate and diminish white people from the moral high ground of ""criticizing their own"" only to then immediately retreat to their jewish identity the moment someone calls on them to check their privilege.

So the most privileged demo, with a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card, continually redirects all class greivances towards the middle-of-the-road demo, and the people in that demo are guilty of a hate crime if they dare to notice this bullshit.

This 100% accurate summation will probably be flagged as anti-Semitism. That's what happens when anyone dares notice this obvious pattern.

I have some disagreements with the statement made by /u/throwawaycuzmeh, but from my reading of it, the statement was critiquing *an alleged pattern of Jewish people engaging in identity politics*. 

If I were to, for example, suggest that ""many black people use identity politics for their own gain,"" would *that* be considered ""engaging in identity politics""? 

Broadly speaking, does *noticing when members of certain ethnic groups cynically and self-servingly deploy identity politics* constitute *engaging in* identity politics?
