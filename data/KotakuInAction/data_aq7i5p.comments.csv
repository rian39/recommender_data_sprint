&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

"35",35,"IWantToTalkNow-",1,1,1,12,0,"Tim laid it out in the best terms Ive ever seen.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"36",36,"MuhTaxReturns",1,1,35,4,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"37",37,"Klaus73",1,1,35,2,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"

"41",41,"Gizortnik",1,1,1,8,0,"&gt;Where has anyone ever claimed that ""calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering them""? Does this just stem from the fact most on that side cant grasp that ""gender"" in context is referring to gender identity, not sex as determined at birth?

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;And getting rid of transphobia is a bad thing why...?

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;And getting rid of transphobia is a bad thing why...?

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

I'm pretty sure they just say this to avoid frightening the center-leftists who might freak out if Twitter outright admitted they are enacting political persecution. No one who works there actually believes it, in my opinion.

It's why I find the calls for Rogan to interview Dorsey again so pointless. It's pretty clear what Dorsey is about at this point. There's no need to try and get him to admit in public what you already know, and what he will never admit. It's like trying to interview an EA executive and get him to, in plain terms, say their business is about destroying companies they acquire by squeezing them dry. "

No.

No.

&gt;or is the market truly going to look towards alternative platforms like Gab and Minds for social media moving forward?

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

That, or Twitter dies when the investors realize how much they've been defrauded.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;And getting rid of transphobia is a bad thing why...?

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

I'm pretty sure they just say this to avoid frightening the center-leftists who might freak out if Twitter outright admitted they are enacting political persecution. No one who works there actually believes it, in my opinion.

It's why I find the calls for Rogan to interview Dorsey again so pointless. It's pretty clear what Dorsey is about at this point.

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

That, or Twitter dies when the investors realize how much they've been defrauded.

"186",35,"IWantToTalkNow-",4,1,1,12,0,"Tim laid it out in the best terms Ive ever seen.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"187",36,"MuhTaxReturns",4,1,35,6,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"188",37,"Klaus73",4,1,35,3,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"189",58,"IWantToTalkNow-",4,3,37,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

I'm pretty sure they just say this to avoid frightening the center-leftists who might freak out if Twitter outright admitted they are enacting political persecution. No one who works there actually believes it, in my opinion.

It's why I find the calls for Rogan to interview Dorsey again so pointless. It's pretty clear what Dorsey is about at this point.

No.

No.

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

That, or Twitter dies when the investors realize how much they've been defrauded.

Conservatives know better because they stand behind free speech. Can't really do that and also believe someone with different ideas is evil.  Wrong sure, but bot necessarily evil.

Conservatives also have a richer tradition of intellectual diversity anyway. It's more a confederation of groups than the monolith the left is. A monolith that lets their extremists take over the whole show.

"247",35,"IWantToTalkNow-",5,1,1,13,0,"Tim laid it out in the best terms Ive ever seen.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"248",36,"MuhTaxReturns",5,1,35,4,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"249",37,"Klaus73",5,1,35,3,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"250",58,"IWantToTalkNow-",5,3,37,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;And getting rid of transphobia is a bad thing why...?

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet.

No.

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

That, or Twitter dies when the investors realize how much they've been defrauded.

"311",35,"IWantToTalkNow-",6,1,1,11,0,"Tim laid it out in the best terms Ive ever seen.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"312",36,"MuhTaxReturns",6,1,35,4,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"313",37,"Klaus73",6,1,35,3,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"314",58,"IWantToTalkNow-",6,3,37,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;And getting rid of transphobia is a bad thing why...?

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

That, or Twitter dies when the investors realize how much they've been defrauded.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"383",81,"MuhTaxReturns",7,7,39,6,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"384",82,"Klaus73",7,7,39,3,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"385",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",7,7,82,0,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

"387",40,"Gizortnik",7,1,1,8,0,"&gt;Where has anyone ever claimed that ""calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering them""? Does this just stem from the fact most on that side cant grasp that ""gender"" in context is referring to gender identity, not sex as determined at birth?

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;And getting rid of transphobia is a bad thing why...?

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

That, or Twitter dies when the investors realize how much they've been defrauded.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"455",81,"MuhTaxReturns",8,7,39,5,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"456",82,"Klaus73",8,7,39,3,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"457",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",8,7,82,0,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

That, or Twitter dies when the investors realize how much they've been defrauded.

"525",38,"IWantToTalkNow-",9,1,1,12,0,"Tim laid it out in the best terms Ive ever seen.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"526",97,"MuhTaxReturns",9,9,38,4,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"527",98,"Klaus73",9,9,38,3,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"528",99,"IWantToTalkNow-",9,9,98,0,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

That, or Twitter dies when the investors realize how much they've been defrauded.

"597",38,"IWantToTalkNow-",10,1,1,14,0,"Tim laid it out in the best terms Ive ever seen.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"598",97,"MuhTaxReturns",10,9,38,6,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"599",98,"Klaus73",10,9,38,3,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"600",99,"IWantToTalkNow-",10,9,98,0,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"672",81,"MuhTaxReturns",11,7,39,8,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"673",82,"Klaus73",11,7,39,2,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"674",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",11,7,82,0,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"746",82,"Klaus73",12,7,39,4,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"747",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",12,7,82,0,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

I'm pretty sure they just say this to avoid frightening the center-leftists who might freak out if Twitter outright admitted they are enacting political persecution. No one who works there actually believes it, in my opinion.

It's why I find the calls for Rogan to interview Dorsey again so pointless. It's pretty clear what Dorsey is about at this point.

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"818",81,"MuhTaxReturns",13,7,39,10,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"819",82,"Klaus73",13,7,39,3,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"820",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",13,7,82,0,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

"823",41,"Gizortnik",13,1,1,11,0,"&gt;Where has anyone ever claimed that ""calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering them""? Does this just stem from the fact most on that side cant grasp that ""gender"" in context is referring to gender identity, not sex as determined at birth?

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

I'm pretty sure they just say this to avoid frightening the center-leftists who might freak out if Twitter outright admitted they are enacting political persecution. No one who works there actually believes it, in my opinion.

It's why I find the calls for Rogan to interview Dorsey again so pointless. It's pretty clear what Dorsey is about at this point. There's no need to try and get him to admit in public what you already know, and what he will never admit. It's like trying to interview an EA executive and get him to, in plain terms, say their business is about destroying companies they acquire by squeezing them dry. "

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

That, or Twitter dies when the investors realize how much they've been defrauded.

Conservatives know better because they stand behind free speech. Can't really do that and also believe someone with different ideas is evil.  Wrong sure, but bot necessarily evil.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"894",85,"MuhTaxReturns",14,7,40,9,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"895",104,"Klaus73",14,14,40,4,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"896",105,"IWantToTalkNow-",14,14,104,0,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."
"897",106,"Klaus73",14,14,105,1,0,"Aye I mean is there realistically enough trans population to warrant a trans league?"
"898",41,"Gizortnik",14,1,1,11,0,"&gt;Where has anyone ever claimed that ""calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering them""? Does this just stem from the fact most on that side cant grasp that ""gender"" in context is referring to gender identity, not sex as determined at birth?

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

&gt;  
&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

"971",105,"IWantToTalkNow-",15,14,104,0,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

There was also a [highly-ranked post in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/aq3zal/censorship_quillette_it_isnt_your_imagination/) regarding the same article today that was posted by /u/md1957 earlier this morning.

What do you guys think can be done about this? Is there any hope for the Twitter platform going forward, do we think that this bias will ever be addressed and/or removed, or is the market truly going to look towards alternative platforms like Gab and Minds for social media moving forward?

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"1044",85,"MuhTaxReturns",16,7,40,11,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"1045",104,"Klaus73",16,14,40,9,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"1046",105,"IWantToTalkNow-",16,14,104,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

What do you guys think can be done about this? Is there any hope for the Twitter platform going forward, do we think that this bias will ever be addressed and/or removed, or is the market truly going to look towards alternative platforms like Gab and Minds for social media moving forward?

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

"1120",41,"IWantToTalkNow-",17,1,1,15,0,"Tim laid it out in the best terms Ive ever seen.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"1121",42,"MuhTaxReturns",17,1,41,9,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"1122",123,"Klaus73",17,17,41,7,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"1123",124,"IWantToTalkNow-",17,17,123,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

It's why I find the calls for Rogan to interview Dorsey again so pointless. It's pretty clear what Dorsey is about at this point.

No.

No.

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

That, or Twitter dies when the investors realize how much they've been defrauded.

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;And getting rid of transphobia is a bad thing why...?

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

"1195",41,"IWantToTalkNow-",18,1,1,16,0,"Tim laid it out in the best terms Ive ever seen.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"1196",42,"MuhTaxReturns",18,1,41,11,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"1197",123,"Klaus73",18,17,41,6,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"1198",124,"IWantToTalkNow-",18,17,123,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

It's why I find the calls for Rogan to interview Dorsey again so pointless. It's pretty clear what Dorsey is about at this point.

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

"1270",41,"IWantToTalkNow-",19,1,1,18,0,"Tim laid it out in the best terms Ive ever seen.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"1272",123,"Klaus73",19,17,41,7,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"1273",124,"IWantToTalkNow-",19,17,123,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

"1345",41,"IWantToTalkNow-",20,1,1,16,0,"Tim laid it out in the best terms Ive ever seen.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"1346",42,"MuhTaxReturns",20,1,41,10,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."

You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"1348",124,"IWantToTalkNow-",20,17,123,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

No.

No.

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

That, or Twitter dies when the investors realize how much they've been defrauded.

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;And getting rid of transphobia is a bad thing why...?

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.


"
"1420",85,"Bithlord",21,7,40,8,0,"&gt;  I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

I don't care what they want.  I care what I want.  Which..  is a pretty human condition, but at least be honest about it.  "
"1421",41,"IWantToTalkNow-",21,1,1,16,0,"Tim laid it out in the best terms Ive ever seen.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"1422",42,"MuhTaxReturns",21,1,41,11,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"1423",123,"Klaus73",21,17,41,6,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"1424",124,"IWantToTalkNow-",21,17,123,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

"1427",127,"IWantToTalkNow-",21,21,126,1,0,"I wouldnt say its purely about a size.  But HRT does affect physical strength, quite clearly.  Im also putting it in context of a co-worker whos trans and is actually both shorter and lighter than that.  There is no way she could ever compete with guys in physical competitive sports, and pretty much 95% of women I know are physically stronger and taller than her.  Basically, not everyone is like the GameStop lady, or the power lifter (who iirc, lifted 130lbs higher than anyone in her weight category, which is ludicrous to allow)

Also read something about bone, especially hip formation and how it affects things, basically men are better built to take a hit, structural.  I understood it to be like shock absorption in men is stronger than in women, but Im very much a layman when it comes to understanding that stuff."

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

It's why I find the calls for Rogan to interview Dorsey again so pointless. It's pretty clear what Dorsey is about at this point.

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"1498",81,"MuhTaxReturns",22,7,39,13,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"1499",82,"Klaus73",22,7,39,8,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"1500",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",22,7,82,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Im also putting it in context of a co-worker whos trans and is actually both shorter and lighter than that.  There is no way she could ever compete with guys in physical competitive sports, and pretty much 95% of women I know are physically stronger and taller than her.  Basically, not everyone is like the GameStop lady, or the power lifter (who iirc, lifted 130lbs higher than anyone in her weight category, which is ludicrous to allow)

"1505",41,"Gizortnik",22,1,1,14,0,"&gt;Where has anyone ever claimed that ""calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering them""? Does this just stem from the fact most on that side cant grasp that ""gender"" in context is referring to gender identity, not sex as determined at birth?

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;And getting rid of transphobia is a bad thing why...?

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"1578",81,"MuhTaxReturns",23,7,39,11,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"1579",82,"Klaus73",23,7,39,8,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"1580",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",23,7,82,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Basically, not everyone is like the GameStop lady, or the power lifter (who iirc, lifted 130lbs higher than anyone in her weight category, which is ludicrous to allow)

"1586",41,"Gizortnik",23,1,1,12,0,"&gt;Where has anyone ever claimed that ""calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering them""? Does this just stem from the fact most on that side cant grasp that ""gender"" in context is referring to gender identity, not sex as determined at birth?

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;And getting rid of transphobia is a bad thing why...?

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"1659",81,"MuhTaxReturns",24,7,39,11,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"1660",82,"Klaus73",24,7,39,7,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"1661",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",24,7,82,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Im also putting it in context of a co-worker whos trans and is actually both shorter and lighter than that.

Basically, not everyone is like the GameStop lady, or the power lifter (who iirc, lifted 130lbs higher than anyone in her weight category, which is ludicrous to allow)

"1667",41,"Gizortnik",24,1,1,13,0,"&gt;Where has anyone ever claimed that ""calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering them""? Does this just stem from the fact most on that side cant grasp that ""gender"" in context is referring to gender identity, not sex as determined at birth?

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"1740",81,"MuhTaxReturns",25,7,39,11,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."

You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"1742",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",25,7,82,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Basically, not everyone is like the GameStop lady, or the power lifter (who iirc, lifted 130lbs higher than anyone in her weight category, which is ludicrous to allow)

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

There was also a [highly-ranked post in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/aq3zal/censorship_quillette_it_isnt_your_imagination/) regarding the same article today that was posted by /u/md1957 earlier this morning.

What do you guys think can be done about this? Is there any hope for the Twitter platform going forward, do we think that this bias will ever be addressed and/or removed, or is the market truly going to look towards alternative platforms like Gab and Minds for social media moving forward?

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."

"1823",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",26,7,82,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

It's why I find the calls for Rogan to interview Dorsey again so pointless. It's pretty clear what Dorsey is about at this point.

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

Conservatives know better because they stand behind free speech. Can't really do that and also believe someone with different ideas is evil.  Wrong sure, but bot necessarily evil.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"1903",82,"Klaus73",27,7,39,8,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"1904",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",27,7,82,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

"1910",41,"Gizortnik",27,1,1,14,0,"&gt;Where has anyone ever claimed that ""calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering them""? Does this just stem from the fact most on that side cant grasp that ""gender"" in context is referring to gender identity, not sex as determined at birth?

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;And getting rid of transphobia is a bad thing why...?

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

It's why I find the calls for Rogan to interview Dorsey again so pointless. It's pretty clear what Dorsey is about at this point.

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"1983",81,"MuhTaxReturns",28,7,39,12,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"1984",82,"Klaus73",28,7,39,5,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"1985",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",28,7,82,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Im also putting it in context of a co-worker whos trans and is actually both shorter and lighter than that.  There is no way she could ever compete with guys in physical competitive sports, and pretty much 95% of women I know are physically stronger and taller than her.  Basically, not everyone is like the GameStop lady, or the power lifter (who iirc, lifted 130lbs higher than anyone in her weight category, which is ludicrous to allow)

Also read something about bone, especially hip formation and how it affects things, basically men are better built to take a hit, structural.  I understood it to be like shock absorption in men is stronger than in women, but Im very much a layman when it comes to understanding that stuff."
"1989",133,"extortioncontortion",28,23,131,1,0,"my point is that men are much stronger than women on a pound for pound basis.  That is in addition to being larger on average.

"1991",41,"Gizortnik",28,1,1,15,0,"&gt;Where has anyone ever claimed that ""calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering them""? Does this just stem from the fact most on that side cant grasp that ""gender"" in context is referring to gender identity, not sex as determined at birth?

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;And getting rid of transphobia is a bad thing why...?

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

"2063",39,"IWantToTalkNow-",29,1,1,17,0,"Tim laid it out in the best terms Ive ever seen.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"2064",81,"MuhTaxReturns",29,7,39,11,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"2065",82,"Klaus73",29,7,39,8,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"2066",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",29,7,82,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Im also putting it in context of a co-worker whos trans and is actually both shorter and lighter than that.  There is no way she could ever compete with guys in physical competitive sports, and pretty much 95% of women I know are physically stronger and taller than her.  Basically, not everyone is like the GameStop lady, or the power lifter (who iirc, lifted 130lbs higher than anyone in her weight category, which is ludicrous to allow)

"2072",41,"Gizortnik",29,1,1,14,0,"&gt;Where has anyone ever claimed that ""calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering them""? Does this just stem from the fact most on that side cant grasp that ""gender"" in context is referring to gender identity, not sex as determined at birth?

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;And getting rid of transphobia is a bad thing why...?

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Conservatives know better because they stand behind free speech. Can't really do that and also believe someone with different ideas is evil.  Wrong sure, but bot necessarily evil.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"2145",81,"MuhTaxReturns",30,7,39,10,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"2146",82,"Klaus73",30,7,39,8,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"2147",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",30,7,82,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

Basically, not everyone is like the GameStop lady, or the power lifter (who iirc, lifted 130lbs higher than anyone in her weight category, which is ludicrous to allow)

"2153",41,"Gizortnik",30,1,1,14,0,"&gt;Where has anyone ever claimed that ""calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering them""? Does this just stem from the fact most on that side cant grasp that ""gender"" in context is referring to gender identity, not sex as determined at birth?

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

&gt;And getting rid of transphobia is a bad thing why...?

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.

&gt;Jack confirms they have a bias and enforce the rules based on their bias

Tim Pool quote-retweeted one of Jack Dorsey's earlier replies to Kara Swisher on Twitter last night, the tweet from Dorsey said as follows:

&gt;\[In reference to what Twitter as a platform has done recently to take responsibility for the things that occur on their site\]  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. Misgendering policy for example.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of the system. #KaraJack*

I encourage people to read through the entire thread between Kara and Jack as it provides more context to the above tweet. It's fascinating to see Twitter as a platform simultaneously banning people based on progressive ideological speech-crimes, whilst claiming that people have a *""right to social media""* and Twitter of course has no political bias against centre-right, right-wing or even libertarian principles and ideas.

Tim also posted a video within the last hour discussing the recent Quillette piece titled [*""It Isn't Your Imagination: Twitter Treats Conservatives More Harshly Than Liberals""*](https://quillette.com/2019/02/12/it-isnt-your-imagination-twitter-treats-conservatives-more-harshly-than-liberals/) which can be [viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6gjkEOqgpg)

Yes, slowly. It takes time for people to change their habits.

Twitter is now mostly funded by investment based off of fraudulent stats and by journalists. So, in order to not destroy Twitter, twitter will need to *flooded* by *hundreds of millions of dollars and users* from conservatives, or *all of journalism will simultaneously become neutral*.

That, or Twitter dies when the investors realize how much they've been defrauded.

Progressives believe that calling a trans woman a man is misgendering.

Conservatives believe that calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering.

This is the crux of the issue.  People want to take transgender issue, and stuff it into an easily identifiable box, and it doesnt quite fit properly.  

Why not simply admit that there are biological differences between men and women and at the same time some people are trans.  You can do almost everything with a trans partner that you can do with anyone else.  No, a trans woman will never be able to give birth (and this is often a huge trigger for dysphoria), but outside of that pretty much everything is feminine.  Of course, some trans people pass better than others, and that seems to make a large difference.  Very few people would go out with the GameStop lady, but a metric fuckton would jump at a chance to be with Blaire White.

But then we come to policy.  And policy is a mess of epic proportions when it comes to trans women.  Say, for divorce law purposes, I believe there is no difference between a trans woman and a cis woman.  For sports, do we now allow trans women to compete with cis-women?  Honestly, sometimes theres so little difference, it wouldnt bother me, on the other hand sometimes the difference is so massive that it would be insane to allow.  What about physical health?  If you go to the CDC, and look for what is considered a healthy weight for a woman, that weight is not the same as for trans women in almost all situations due to things like bone density, musculature, etc.  Theyd be close, but not identical.  And once you get into the realm of law and criminal justice, theres even more of a mess.  It becomes a game of consistently splitting hairs.  Some of them dont need to be split, some are pretty important.

The best answer I can find is this:  Treat them like you would anyone else of that gender.  Equally, that applies to recognizing that every group has its crazies, and here, we tend to focus more on the nut job, completely radical trans activists.  Theres plenty of plain ol trans people who just go about their day, think the radicals are just as awful as most people do, and try and make their lives more bearable and look for what everyone else is: meet someone, have a job, have a life and hope its not too shitty.  This should not be a contentious view."
"2226",81,"MuhTaxReturns",31,7,39,10,0,"Blaire is hot but her bone structure is quite manly (well not quite, literally). She's a well framed and sturdy boned person. This was really apparent to me when she went on The Rubin Report.

But you are spot on. I assume most Trans people who aren't rage activists just want to live normal boring lives and practically NOBODY has an issue with that -- even the super religious southern person would be like 'whatever'.

It's like back when gay marriage was a hot topic, all the miserable straight married men were like 'if they wanna be miserable like everyone else then so be it'."
"2227",82,"Klaus73",31,7,39,6,0,"Speaking about the sports issue; part of the problem is *some* tranwomen argue there is no difference between them an a very gifted female athlete. You got issues like Caster Semenya where they let her compete but unless she was handcapped she destroyed other women (and she isn't even trans she is intersex) so yeah I think there probably needs to be some meeting part way before both sides are willing to just call it as they see it (if I think I see a dude...I use he..not because I despise trans..if I do an you assume I made an honest mistake an ask to be refered to as a she..sure. if you demand I call you a she..then I will extend to you the same respect an goodwill you showed me)"
"2228",83,"IWantToTalkNow-",31,7,82,1,0,"Nah, I didn't assume you have any anger or hatred towards trans people, that wouldn't make sense based on what you just said.

I think there's a large grey area when it comes to the sports type thing.  A trans woman who's 5'5 and weighs 130lbs can probably have not much issue competing with other women.  But, if they're taller, heavier, longer before they started transition, and a bunch of other factors, it tends to become pretty unfair to the other women.  And it sucks for trans women who fit that mold.  And there's other scientific differences as well, but I feel this only really applies to competitive sports, especially when people are putting in maximum effort.  These things matter a lot less when you're just say going out to see a movie, or cuddling, they matter almost so little that there's virtually no difference.  

Then you have someone pop up and say ""Hey!  I transitioned!  Why are you saying I still can't do these things?  I'm a woman too, just like them.""  Then comes in all the ideology and radicalism.  

I try to think about things this way, to try and come to a sensible solution:  If you were a parent, and your kid was putting in all the effort for a competitive sport (diet, exercise, practice, money and travel, etc), you'd be real pissed under either situation:  a trans woman who can't compete even though they're dying too and killing themselves too do it, they shouldn't be held back just because they're trans.  Or a cis woman, putting in identical effort, but someone they're competing against has a real, clear, easily demonstratable advantage, they shouldn't be held back because of that.  The competition is supposed to be fair.  But, if you separate trans and cis for competitive purposes, you know there's gonna be a ton of ridicule and mockery aimed at that.  

Basically, it's a mess."

"2231",131,"IWantToTalkNow-",31,22,130,1,0,"I wouldnt say its purely about a size.  But HRT does affect physical strength, quite clearly.  Im also putting it in context of a co-worker whos trans and is actually both shorter and lighter than that.  There is no way she could ever compete with guys in physical competitive sports, and pretty much 95% of women I know are physically stronger and taller than her.  Basically, not everyone is like the GameStop lady, or the power lifter (who iirc, lifted 130lbs higher than anyone in her weight category, which is ludicrous to allow)

Also read something about bone, especially hip formation and how it affects things, basically men are better built to take a hit, structural.  I understood it to be like shock absorption in men is stronger than in women, but Im very much a layman when it comes to understanding that stuff."

"2234",41,"Gizortnik",31,1,1,13,0,"&gt;Where has anyone ever claimed that ""calling a trans woman a woman is misgendering them""? Does this just stem from the fact most on that side cant grasp that ""gender"" in context is referring to gender identity, not sex as determined at birth?

Amazing. ""It's not misgendering if I don't hear people say it's misgendering in the specific way I want it to be said.""

If conservatives are referring to a transwoman as a man, because she was born as a male, then by definition, calling them a woman, is misgendering a man.

This followed up by a deflection about gender and gender-identity are not the same thing. To bad for you that you're intentionally using double speak since you know good god damned well that there's a difference between gender and gender-identity and you intentionally use *both* in the same way to confuse people.

&gt;Tim. The difference is that the overwhelming majority of us trans women want to be called women. It has nothing to do with ideology, and everything to do with what we want. I don't care what the progressives or the right want, only how I want to be addressed.

Nobody cares how you want to be addressed, and yes it does have to do with ideology. You think that your gender is something that it actually isn't. Or you think your gender-identity doesn't conform to your gender, so therefore you should be referred to as your gender-identity instead of your gender when people refer to your ""gender"". That is based on a social constructionist interpretation of anatomy and physiology. That is explicitly political.

Not only that, but normally when you call anyone *anything* but their name, you are not referring to them how they want to be refereed to, and even then, you didn't ask them what name they would have preferred. So, you want the rest of the world to abide by rules that benefit your concept of a protected class of people, and that you *never* are required to reciprocate.

It's not transphobia you delusional sycophant. That, and it sure as hell isn't the place of hundred million dollar corporations to enforce political and cultural activism.
