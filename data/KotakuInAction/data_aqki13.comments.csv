It has more to do with Luke Skywalker being both a white male and positive role model and hero to boys all over the world.


Disney can't have A FUCKING WHITE MALE as the lead character of the Star Wars franchise! He must be revised!



It's the same reason they made solo. They took a cool male hero and turned him in to an orphan with a heart of gold who only got in to the smuggler business to impress a girl.

It has more to do with Luke Skywalker being both a white male and positive role model and hero to boys all over the world.


Disney can't have A FUCKING WHITE MALE as the lead character of the Star Wars franchise! He must be revised!



It's the same reason they made solo. They took a cool male hero and turned him in to an orphan with a heart of gold who only got in to the smuggler business to impress a girl.

Disney can't have A FUCKING WHITE MALE as the lead character of the Star Wars franchise! He must be revised!



It's the same reason they made solo. They took a cool male hero and turned him in to an orphan with a heart of gold who only got in to the smuggler business to impress a girl.

I think that Lucasfilm ruined Star Wars. And I think that Disney is probably really angry about it. 

I think Disney invested a fortune into things like Star Wars Land as a way to compete with Harry Potter Land at their theme parks. I think they wanted massive toy sales.

So they bought Star Wars to get content that older boys would love so that they could appeal to the whole family.

I think that Lucasfilm ruined Star Wars. And I think that Disney is probably really angry about it. 

I think Disney invested a fortune into things like Star Wars Land as a way to compete with Harry Potter Land at their theme parks. I think they wanted massive toy sales.

It has more to do with Luke Skywalker being both a white male and positive role model and hero to boys all over the world.


Disney can't have A FUCKING WHITE MALE as the lead character of the Star Wars franchise! He must be revised!



It's the same reason they made solo. They took a cool male hero and turned him in to an orphan with a heart of gold who only got in to the smuggler business to impress a girl.

So they bought Star Wars to get content that older boys would love so that they could appeal to the whole family.

I think that Lucasfilm ruined Star Wars. And I think that Disney is probably really angry about it. 

I think Disney invested a fortune into things like Star Wars Land as a way to compete with Harry Potter Land at their theme parks. I think they wanted massive toy sales. 

The idea that all the Reys and Roses are ending up in the bargain bin is probably really pissing them off. 

I would put serious money on Disney trying to salvage Star Wars by making major course corrections. They already cancelled a bunch of other Star Wars movies. "

It has more to do with Luke Skywalker being both a white male and positive role model and hero to boys all over the world.


Disney can't have A FUCKING WHITE MALE as the lead character of the Star Wars franchise! He must be revised!



It's the same reason they made solo. They took a cool male hero and turned him in to an orphan with a heart of gold who only got in to the smuggler business to impress a girl.


You just know that if Carrie Fisher didn't die they were planning to have Leia go full Luke Skywalker and solo Kylo Ren and the First Order in Episode IX."

Is there anyone who still accepts Disney crap as canon? It's a complete joke. It's like Vanilla Ice buying the rights to Queen and putting out a new album and saying that all previous albums no longer count.

And they wanted to be able to sell toys and theme park tickets to the whole family. 

So they bought Star Wars to get content that older boys would love so that they could appeal to the whole family. 

I dont know if the sabotage or Star Wars is Disneys doing. I think its more that Lucas put Kennedy in charge and she is doing her own thing with it. No matter what she was in charge of, she would have the force is female-d it. "
"1674",88,"Stryker7200",32,22,50,3,0,"Its on Kennedy imo.  She is the one repeatedly informing people of this ideology.  Its too bad Disney wasnt more involved and just let her run everything so autonomously."

He sort of entrusted Lucasfilm to her and implied she betrayed him in that one interview. 

I bet Disney execs were so overconfident because of Marvel and thought they could just let the creatives do their thing.

I blame Kennedy too. 

We can laugh at the DC Universe or the Dark Universe of monster movies for never really getting off the ground. But Star Wars is poised to go down in history as one of the biggest fuck-ups of all time. 

Seriously. If they didnt piss off the fans by assassinating Luke, they could have released bland uninspired blockbusters like Rogue One every year and fanboys would have eaten it up. Every year.
