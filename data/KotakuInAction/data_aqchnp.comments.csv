\&gt;have to pay reparations because one ancestor was a slave owner

So is this the modern One-Drop Rule? Also yeah, this looks like a massive lawsuit waiting to happen. Also would African Americans descended from the children slave-owners sired on their slaves also have to pay this?"
"4",4,"Gizortnik",1,1,3,62,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"5",5,"MajinAsh",1,1,4,18,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"6",6,"Gizortnik",1,1,5,23,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

"88",6,"Gizortnik",3,1,5,32,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably.

But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"186",5,"MajinAsh",5,1,4,28,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"187",6,"Gizortnik",5,1,5,33,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

\&gt;have to pay reparations because one ancestor was a slave owner

So is this the modern One-Drop Rule? Also yeah, this looks like a massive lawsuit waiting to happen. Also would African Americans descended from the children slave-owners sired on their slaves also have to pay this?"
"309",4,"Gizortnik",7,1,3,121,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"310",5,"MajinAsh",7,1,4,29,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"311",6,"Gizortnik",7,1,5,35,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

So is this the modern One-Drop Rule? Also yeah, this looks like a massive lawsuit waiting to happen. Also would African Americans descended from the children slave-owners sired on their slaves also have to pay this?"
"379",4,"Gizortnik",8,1,3,126,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck?

It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*.

So is this the modern One-Drop Rule? Also yeah, this looks like a massive lawsuit waiting to happen. Also would African Americans descended from the children slave-owners sired on their slaves also have to pay this?"
"525",4,"Gizortnik",10,1,3,133,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"526",5,"MajinAsh",10,1,4,34,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"527",6,"Gizortnik",10,1,5,43,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

"604",4,"Gizortnik",11,1,3,135,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"605",5,"MajinAsh",11,1,4,38,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"606",6,"Gizortnik",11,1,5,48,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"607",80,"MajinAsh",11,10,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

"609",86,"Gizortnik",11,11,80,1,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."

So is this the modern One-Drop Rule? Also yeah, this looks like a massive lawsuit waiting to happen. Also would African Americans descended from the children slave-owners sired on their slaves also have to pay this?"
"687",4,"Gizortnik",12,1,3,139,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"688",5,"MajinAsh",12,1,4,35,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"689",6,"Gizortnik",12,1,5,54,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"690",80,"continous",12,10,6,1,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."
"691",92,"MajinAsh",12,12,6,0,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

I guess I misunderstand what reparations are.  I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person."
"692",93,"umizumiz",12,12,92,1,0,"the making of amends for a wrong one has done, by paying money to or otherwise helping those who have been wronged

reparations"
"693",94,"Gizortnik",12,12,92,1,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"694",95,"continous",12,12,94,1,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

So is this the modern One-Drop Rule? Also yeah, this looks like a massive lawsuit waiting to happen. Also would African Americans descended from the children slave-owners sired on their slaves also have to pay this?"
"774",4,"Gizortnik",13,1,3,149,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"775",5,"MajinAsh",13,1,4,37,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"776",6,"Gizortnik",13,1,5,59,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"777",80,"continous",13,10,6,2,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."
"778",81,"Gizortnik",13,10,80,1,0,"&gt;Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. 

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

"780",92,"MajinAsh",13,12,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

I guess I misunderstand what reparations are.  I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person."
"781",93,"Gizortnik",13,12,92,2,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"782",106,"continous",13,13,93,2,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

"870",4,"Gizortnik",14,1,3,154,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"871",5,"MajinAsh",14,1,4,36,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"872",6,"Gizortnik",14,1,5,56,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"873",80,"continous",14,10,6,2,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

"876",117,"Gizortnik",14,14,105,1,0,"&gt;I would suggest that this is in name only.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

"879",119,"Gizortnik",14,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"880",120,"continous",14,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

"972",4,"Gizortnik",15,1,3,159,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."

"974",6,"Gizortnik",15,1,5,59,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"975",80,"continous",15,10,6,2,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

"984",119,"Gizortnik",15,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"985",120,"continous",15,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"1084",5,"MajinAsh",16,1,4,43,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"1085",6,"Gizortnik",16,1,5,62,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"1086",80,"continous",16,10,6,2,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

"1089",117,"Gizortnik",16,14,105,1,0,"&gt;I would suggest that this is in name only.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"1095",118,"MajinAsh",16,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

I guess I misunderstand what reparations are.  I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person."
"1096",119,"Gizortnik",16,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"1097",120,"continous",16,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person.

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"1213",120,"continous",17,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

"1319",4,"Gizortnik",18,1,3,167,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"1322",80,"continous",18,10,6,3,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"1331",118,"MajinAsh",18,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

"1332",119,"Gizortnik",18,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"1333",120,"continous",18,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

"1440",4,"Gizortnik",19,1,3,170,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"1441",5,"MajinAsh",19,1,4,43,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"1442",6,"Gizortnik",19,1,5,64,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"1443",80,"continous",19,10,6,3,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"1452",118,"MajinAsh",19,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

I guess I misunderstand what reparations are.  I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person."

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"1454",120,"continous",19,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

"1562",4,"Gizortnik",20,1,3,170,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965).

Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."

"1575",119,"Gizortnik",20,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"1576",120,"continous",20,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

So is this the modern One-Drop Rule? Also yeah, this looks like a massive lawsuit waiting to happen. Also would African Americans descended from the children slave-owners sired on their slaves also have to pay this?"
"1684",4,"Gizortnik",21,1,3,172,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"1685",5,"MajinAsh",21,1,4,43,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"1686",6,"Gizortnik",21,1,5,61,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"1687",80,"continous",21,10,6,3,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."
"1688",81,"Gizortnik",21,10,80,2,0,"&gt;Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. 

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

"1690",117,"Gizortnik",21,14,105,1,0,"&gt;I would suggest that this is in name only.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

It's not that tribal governments are entirely fictitious, but they aren't independent."

Even if *all* the property wasn't returned, there was probably some kind of half-assed compensation. You're talking about creating well over a million homeless refugees and depositing them on the west coast if you just push them out of the internment camps."
"1693",106,"Kyobi",21,13,93,2,0,"It was a half assed compensation like 20k USD. A good chunk of them died. Not very many Japanese Americans exist today actually(in proportion to other east asians). The top earners are a different breed of Asians and likely did not descend from the Japanese internment survivors.

Looking at the stats again, it was only 120k people.(70% were born in america)It was reported that some figure around 1k died from old age, disease, and gunshots, but we'll never really know for sure as the investigation was openned in the carter administration 40 years later."

It hurt not being able to return home, but moving into a new home helped me I believe. I think it helped me to bury the past a little, to, you know, move on from what had happened."" - Aya Nakamura

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"1696",118,"MajinAsh",21,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

I guess I misunderstand what reparations are.  I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person."
"1697",119,"Gizortnik",21,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"1698",120,"continous",21,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

So is this the modern One-Drop Rule? Also yeah, this looks like a massive lawsuit waiting to happen. Also would African Americans descended from the children slave-owners sired on their slaves also have to pay this?"
"1806",4,"Gizortnik",22,1,3,177,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"1807",5,"MajinAsh",22,1,4,43,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"1808",6,"Gizortnik",22,1,5,65,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"1809",80,"continous",22,10,6,3,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

"1812",117,"Gizortnik",22,14,105,1,0,"&gt;I would suggest that this is in name only.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

It hurt not being able to return home, but moving into a new home helped me I believe. I think it helped me to bury the past a little, to, you know, move on from what had happened."" - Aya Nakamura

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"1818",118,"MajinAsh",22,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

I guess I misunderstand what reparations are.  I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person."
"1819",119,"Gizortnik",22,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"1820",120,"continous",22,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965).

Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"1941",118,"MajinAsh",23,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

I guess I misunderstand what reparations are.  I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person."
"1942",119,"Gizortnik",23,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"1943",120,"continous",23,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

\&gt;have to pay reparations because one ancestor was a slave owner

So is this the modern One-Drop Rule? Also yeah, this looks like a massive lawsuit waiting to happen. Also would African Americans descended from the children slave-owners sired on their slaves also have to pay this?"
"2052",4,"Gizortnik",24,1,3,175,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"2053",5,"MajinAsh",24,1,4,43,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"2054",6,"Gizortnik",24,1,5,63,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities.

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"2064",118,"MajinAsh",24,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"2066",120,"continous",24,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

So is this the modern One-Drop Rule? Also yeah, this looks like a massive lawsuit waiting to happen. Also would African Americans descended from the children slave-owners sired on their slaves also have to pay this?"
"2175",4,"Gizortnik",25,1,3,172,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"2176",5,"MajinAsh",25,1,4,43,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"2177",6,"Gizortnik",25,1,5,62,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"2178",80,"continous",25,10,6,3,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

It hurt not being able to return home, but moving into a new home helped me I believe. I think it helped me to bury the past a little, to, you know, move on from what had happened."" - Aya Nakamura

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"2187",118,"MajinAsh",25,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

I guess I misunderstand what reparations are.  I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person."
"2188",119,"Gizortnik",25,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"2189",120,"continous",25,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person.

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965).

Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"2312",120,"continous",26,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

"2421",4,"Gizortnik",27,1,3,179,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."

"2423",6,"Gizortnik",27,1,5,62,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"2433",118,"MajinAsh",27,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

"2434",119,"Gizortnik",27,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"2435",120,"continous",27,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

So is this the modern One-Drop Rule? Also yeah, this looks like a massive lawsuit waiting to happen. Also would African Americans descended from the children slave-owners sired on their slaves also have to pay this?"
"2544",4,"Gizortnik",28,1,3,175,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"2545",5,"MajinAsh",28,1,4,45,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"2546",6,"Gizortnik",28,1,5,64,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"2547",80,"continous",28,10,6,3,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

"2550",117,"Gizortnik",28,14,105,1,0,"&gt;I would suggest that this is in name only.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

"2553",106,"Kyobi",28,13,93,2,0,"It was a half assed compensation like 20k USD. A good chunk of them died. Not very many Japanese Americans exist today actually(in proportion to other east asians). The top earners are a different breed of Asians and likely did not descend from the Japanese internment survivors.

Looking at the stats again, it was only 120k people.(70% were born in america)It was reported that some figure around 1k died from old age, disease, and gunshots, but we'll never really know for sure as the investigation was openned in the carter administration 40 years later."

Home wasn't where I left it though. Getting back, I was just shocked to see what had happened, our home being bought by a different family, different decorations in the windows; it was our house, but it wasn't anymore. It hurt not being able to return home, but moving into a new home helped me I believe. I think it helped me to bury the past a little, to, you know, move on from what had happened."" - Aya Nakamura

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"2556",118,"MajinAsh",28,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

I guess I misunderstand what reparations are.  I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person."
"2557",119,"Gizortnik",28,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"2558",120,"continous",28,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person.

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965).

Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"2682",120,"continous",29,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

"2792",4,"Gizortnik",30,1,3,178,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person.

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"2804",118,"MajinAsh",30,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

I guess I misunderstand what reparations are.  I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person."
"2805",119,"Gizortnik",30,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"2806",120,"continous",30,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

"2916",4,"Gizortnik",31,1,3,181,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"2917",5,"MajinAsh",31,1,4,40,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"2918",6,"Gizortnik",31,1,5,63,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"2919",80,"continous",31,10,6,3,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"2928",118,"MajinAsh",31,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

I guess I misunderstand what reparations are.  I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person."
"2929",119,"Gizortnik",31,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"2930",120,"continous",31,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

"3040",4,"Gizortnik",32,1,3,180,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965).

Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"3054",120,"continous",32,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

"3164",4,"Gizortnik",33,1,3,179,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."

It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"3167",80,"continous",33,10,6,3,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"3176",118,"MajinAsh",33,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"3178",120,"continous",33,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

"3288",4,"Gizortnik",34,1,3,179,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."

It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"3291",80,"continous",34,10,6,3,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"3300",118,"MajinAsh",34,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

"3301",119,"Gizortnik",34,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"3302",120,"continous",34,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965).

Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"3426",120,"continous",35,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

"3537",4,"Gizortnik",36,1,3,177,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"3540",80,"continous",36,10,6,3,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"3549",118,"MajinAsh",36,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"3551",120,"continous",36,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

"3662",4,"Gizortnik",37,1,3,182,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

"3664",6,"Gizortnik",37,1,5,62,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"3665",80,"continous",37,10,6,4,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"3676",120,"continous",37,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck?

It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person.

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965).

Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"3802",120,"continous",38,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"3919",5,"MajinAsh",39,1,4,45,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"3920",6,"Gizortnik",39,1,5,70,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"3921",80,"continous",39,10,6,5,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

It's not that tribal governments are entirely fictitious, but they aren't independent."

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"3930",118,"MajinAsh",39,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

I guess I misunderstand what reparations are.  I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person."
"3931",119,"Gizortnik",39,14,118,3,0,"&gt;I thought they were a specific form of compensation for damages inflicted by society as a whole rather than a single person.

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"3932",120,"continous",39,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."

"4048",4,"Gizortnik",40,1,3,182,0,"Reparations have actually already been tried with native American tribes. The Obama administration made a *massive* settlement to a series of suing tribal governments. Over a billion dollars. It's created a massive crisis called ""Tribal Disenrollment"". 

Basically, as the tribes got their checks in the mail they realized that the total amount of money was being divided by the total amount of members. So there's been a flurry of purity spirals where lots of people, some who don't even live on reservations are being disenrolled from their own tribes because they don't have documentation to prove certain forms of ancestry. As the government payouts get smaller, the tribal governments disenroll more people, sometimes they are simply disenrolling their own political opponents within the tribe, it's turned into a *giant* shit storm.

Now take all of that, and try this with slave decedents, who have no official government representation. If you're black and you can't prove that you're decedent to a slave, you don't get shit. But you know what that *also* means? If you're white or Mulatto, and *can'* prove that you're the effective decedent of a slave? You get money. How fucking angry do you think people are going to be when black people in ghettos *don't* get paychecks because their family actually immigrated to the US in the 30's, black upper-middle class Yale students don't get checks because their family migrated to the US in the 70's, and the poor white guy in Alabama gets a check because his great grandfather was the product of ""miscegenation"" in the 20's and he has the criminal records to prove it.  Yeah, I'm sure everything will go fine.

Oh, and who's going to be supervising this distribution system and reviewing people's racial histories to verify that they are ""black"" or ""slave"" enough to qualify for a paycheck? Oh that's right, some ""community organizer"" identiarian activists probably. I'm sure they won't use it as a weapon to get free money and undermine their political opponents, *like the tribes already did*.

*Real* reparations haven't been tried yet."
"4049",5,"MajinAsh",40,1,4,48,0,"Didnt we try real reparations after the Japanese internment camps during WWII?"
"4050",6,"Gizortnik",40,1,5,69,0,"Yes, but you'll note that we didn't give reparations to Japanese Americans who were not interned, and at first we didn't even give payments back to people who had been deported. It's not a whole race policy, it's an *articulable damage* that can be defined in court and accounted for with living witnesses and plaintiffs. Including lost wages, lost property, ect. We can come to a very specific allotment of damages to a specific individual or individuals. In reality, the government paid about $20,000 per person, totaling somewhere around $50 million, which is actually a god damned bargain had Japanese Americans filed a class action suit for lost property and wages.

These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"". 

For the tribes, while it is true that they were compensation for damages incurred by treaty violations going back to **19**80, because of how the tribes have decided to handle disbursements, they are reparations in all but names. There are even arguments about how people can't claim a disbursement unless they have 4-6 generations enrolled in the family (even though the lawsuit only went back to 1980). For all intents and purposes these are *functionally* reparation payments resulting from a compensatory settlement with the government.

For slave-descended Americans, this creates a whole different problem that is mostly ideological. The argument is that enslavement caused such historical damage and social immobility (including mandatory illiteracy policies) that it prevented slave-descended Americans from obtaining levels of wealth that other American demographics were able to achieve in less time. This argument actually falls on it's face when you see *freed slaves achieving social mobility in the North and West*, but then hitting an upper limit from *segregation* rather than slavery. It's not clear that there is *any* clear and consistent articulable damage that slavery caused, and while we can summarize that it's *probable* that *some* damage would have occurred from relating trauma, brutality, intellectual stagnation, or medical injuries. However, this didn't seem to stop the freed slaves who became successful once the institution of slavery collapse. The idea of reparations is that some amount of money can be *forced* onto the slave-decedent population that would make them monetarily and socially *equitable* to the rest of society, but there's no evidence to suggest that this *would* happen in the same way that Affirmative Action in education doesn't guarantee that people will become better skilled.

On top of that, there's no evidence to suggest Japanese Americans were successful or made equitable *because* of these payments. Japanese Americans *despite being segregated and discriminated against in the west and forcibly interned* were able to make huge leaps and bounds in the form of social mobility *decades before any payments were made*. If it were truly the case that these payments could make the Japanese demographic equitable to all others, it would have only happened *after* the payments, and the payments would have needed to be a lot higher anyways."
"4051",80,"continous",40,10,6,3,0,"Yeah, the biggest difference I can see is that the Japanese don't have a pseudo-government that's dictating who gets claim to the damages, and the damages need to be thoroughly proven. It also happened recently enough that the cultural and ethnic makeup of the damaged parties didn't change significantly.

The issues with providing reparations for even something like Jim Crow laws is that ***even if we could document every single possible victim***, we'd have to determine the amount of damages appropriate to each person. Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow."

It's not just ""pseudo-governments"", several tribes are *entirely foreign nations*. That's an easy calculation because that means that the contracts were with the tribal government, and it was the tribal government that gets the pay out. After that, the disbursements are on the tribes, no the government, so it doesn't have to make any hard choices about membership.

&gt; Not to mention the eventual outcry to come from rich people and white people getting reparations as well. It'd just be a massive shitshow.

Not just that, but also there's going to be white people who are decedents of ""miscegenation"", who can document that their ancestors were slaves. While black immigrants to the US who came *after* slavery wouldn't get anything."

Depending on the tribe, it may be a psuedo-government, but some are held as genuine foreign entities. The problem with tribal sovereignty is that because the land they own is also under the ownership of the federal government, and they don't have the ability to prosecute non-tribal members on their territory, and due to a host of other features, I'd classify these tribal governments as ""Vassal States"".

When there is a will there is a way to survive. There were no reparations for at least 40 years. Keep in mind that during this time, the Chinese exclusion act was also a thing(partially repealed in the 1940's and fully repealed in 1965). They had to resettle on their own in the midwest or the east. Actually there was a sizable group of people who were against resettlement and wanted them deported(despite the fact that they were born in america)."
"4060",118,"MajinAsh",40,14,6,1,0,"&gt; These are not really what anyone would properly argue are ""reparations"" they are ""compensation for damages"".

Reparations are a concept that is designed to bring about income and social equity to an oppressed population by the re-distribution of wealth from the oppressor group to the oppressed group. The idea is that if groups A and B start with social equity and wealth equality, and group A is oppressed by group B, after several decades group A has a net wealth of $50 million less than group B, than reparations should be paid to group A in order to bring group A and B back to wealth and social equity (meaning in this case their net worth is the same).

/u/umizumiz makes a point about a ""wrong"", and there is credence to that. These are payments for ""moral wrongs"" or ""injustices"" (as the left would call it). Damages are an articulate amount of monetary loss that can be proven from the actions of an individual. We can easily account and compensate people for damages. It is impossible to objectively measure a moral wrong / injustice however."
"4062",120,"continous",40,14,119,3,0,"That's another one of the noticeable differences with internment compensations. It was easily quantifiable just how much each person lost. Your house was X value, you didn't work for Y hours at Z wage, and lost your business of value A. You get B many freedom bux as compensation.

Unfortunately;

***We have literally no idea how to calculate this for generations of damages***. A good example of this even outside of reparations, is the idea of a certain family in a town being wrongfully discriminated against for their relation to a psychopath or mass murderer. There is no way to even fathom the potential damages of that because it is simply ***far too systemic and long-term***. We're lucky to be able to calculate someone's losses from a years worth of mistreatment, let alone a lifetime's worth or more."
