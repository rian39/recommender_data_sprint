I'll get downvoted to hell, but I still don't understand how jews are seen as a race but muslims are seen as religious people. Maybe it's because I grew up in a country where we don't really get up in arms about religion or maybe it's because I'm ignorant idk.

Judaism is an ethno-religion, they generally don't seek or even outright attempt to discourage converts and spread solely by family ties. Islam like Christianity is an evangelical religion seeking converts.

I'll get downvoted to hell, but I still don't understand how jews are seen as a race but muslims are seen as religious people. Maybe it's because I grew up in a country where we don't really get up in arms about religion or maybe it's because I'm ignorant idk.

Also Gal Gadot is so white looking it's laughable, she's one of the safest (and blandest) choices for Wonder Woman imo. I still can't believe they didn't go with a better actress, but wokeness factor counts for more points than an actual actress I guess."

Judaism is an ethno-religion, they generally don't seek or even outright attempt to discourage converts and spread solely by family ties. Islam like Christianity is an evangelical religion seeking converts.

For example: before the new Star Wars trilogy, Disney put out a casting call for male actors in their 20s/30s and a female in her late teens/early 20s."

So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

I got the vibe she was basically right on everything and had no room for being wrong."
"1316",300,"Gizortnik",8,5,245,2,0,"This isn't necessarily narcisism showing, but it's still an effect of the ideological totalism that the narcissists generate around them. It's not just that they're in an echo bubble, it's more of an echo dome. Everyone inside the dome talks about how they're glad that they're in this dome, because everyone else's domes are shittier. So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power. Been there, done that."

Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago.

I'll get downvoted to hell, but I still don't understand how jews are seen as a race but muslims are seen as religious people. Maybe it's because I grew up in a country where we don't really get up in arms about religion or maybe it's because I'm ignorant idk.

Also Gal Gadot is so white looking it's laughable, she's one of the safest (and blandest) choices for Wonder Woman imo. I still can't believe they didn't go with a better actress, but wokeness factor counts for more points than an actual actress I guess."

Judaism is an ethno-religion, they generally don't seek or even outright attempt to discourage converts and spread solely by family ties. Islam like Christianity is an evangelical religion seeking converts.

Of course there's a difference between Ashkenazi (European), Sephardi (Hispanic), Mizrahi (Middle-Eastern), &amp; Beta Israel (Ethiopian) Jews but that's the general idea."

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you.

Post infinity war will be the test. So many contracts will be up and heroes retired. What they do next can determine their success.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Typically speaking, major film franchises try to cast late teens/early 20s women in leading roles so that they're still relatively fit and attractive 3+ films and 5+ years in. For example: before the new Star Wars trilogy, Disney put out a casting call for male actors in their 20s/30s and a female in her late teens/early 20s."

Don't be silly, that's not going to happen...... Marvel isn't getting a next phase, it just peters out after the next Avengers film, because people are only watching it now, because they are pot committed to see how the Thanos thing ends. 

Frankly if Thanos hadn't been teased in the earlier movies, they would have already opted out.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them.

"3093",547,"Gizortnik",15,15,546,6,0,"This isn't necessarily narcisism showing, but it's still an effect of the ideological totalism that the narcissists generate around them. It's not just that they're in an echo bubble, it's more of an echo dome. Everyone inside the dome talks about how they're glad that they're in this dome, because everyone else's domes are shittier. So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

It's not just that they're in an echo bubble, it's more of an echo dome. Everyone inside the dome talks about how they're glad that they're in this dome, because everyone else's domes are shittier. So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power. Been there, done that."
"3367",548,"ThatDeviantOne",16,15,547,3,0,"That would certainly explain a lot. While all those things do exist, SJWs think they're far more common than they actually are. Yet these things are becoming a lot less common. Even a few years ago, gay marriage was made legal nation wide in America. Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago. Another decade can pass, way more rights can be gained, and someone like her will still declare the world a shitty place.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

"3641",547,"Gizortnik",17,15,546,6,0,"This isn't necessarily narcisism showing, but it's still an effect of the ideological totalism that the narcissists generate around them. It's not just that they're in an echo bubble, it's more of an echo dome. Everyone inside the dome talks about how they're glad that they're in this dome, because everyone else's domes are shittier. So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power. Been there, done that."
"3642",548,"ThatDeviantOne",17,15,547,3,0,"That would certainly explain a lot. While all those things do exist, SJWs think they're far more common than they actually are. Yet these things are becoming a lot less common. Even a few years ago, gay marriage was made legal nation wide in America. Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago. Another decade can pass, way more rights can be gained, and someone like her will still declare the world a shitty place. ""But, there's still way more cisgender people than transgender people on TV"" or something like that."

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

LOL there is no such thing as to big to fail. In fact big things not only fail, they fail all the time. In fact all things fail eventually, so I'm not sure why people keep on insisting some things are to big to fail.

Long before they even get there they still have a wealth of heroes they can plunder (and hopefully make good movies). 

Post infinity war will be the test. So many contracts will be up and heroes retired. What they do next can determine their success. 

Ghostbusters was just a shitshow bad movie. They mistook the negative reaction as people picking on them. 

Star Wars is just too narrow. Theres not a lot of potential in story - its vanilla good vs evil especially when you just focus it around the skywalkers. "

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

"3917",547,"Gizortnik",18,15,546,8,0,"This isn't necessarily narcisism showing, but it's still an effect of the ideological totalism that the narcissists generate around them. It's not just that they're in an echo bubble, it's more of an echo dome. Everyone inside the dome talks about how they're glad that they're in this dome, because everyone else's domes are shittier. So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power. Been there, done that."

Yet these things are becoming a lot less common. Even a few years ago, gay marriage was made legal nation wide in America. Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago. Another decade can pass, way more rights can be gained, and someone like her will still declare the world a shitty place.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

If we take a look at fashion and women's clothing throughout the ages, there's always *some* issue that someone will think was/is problematic. In the 20s it was showing a little bit of skin. in the 60s-70s-80s it was the bra or tight fitting clothing. in the 90s-00s it was showing your thong whenever you'd bend over.

We women can never win, we will always hate ourselves/other women and we will shame one another for looking like we want to, and that's not even taking the ""male gaze"" into account.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them.

I got the vibe she was basically right on everything and had no room for being wrong."
"4194",547,"Gizortnik",19,15,546,7,0,"This isn't necessarily narcisism showing, but it's still an effect of the ideological totalism that the narcissists generate around them. It's not just that they're in an echo bubble, it's more of an echo dome. Everyone inside the dome talks about how they're glad that they're in this dome, because everyone else's domes are shittier. So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power. Been there, done that."
"4195",548,"ThatDeviantOne",19,15,547,3,0,"That would certainly explain a lot. While all those things do exist, SJWs think they're far more common than they actually are. Yet these things are becoming a lot less common. Even a few years ago, gay marriage was made legal nation wide in America. Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago. Another decade can pass, way more rights can be gained, and someone like her will still declare the world a shitty place. ""But, there's still way more cisgender people than transgender people on TV"" or something like that."

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them.

"4526",140,"ThatDeviantOne",20,2,139,7,0,"When I talked (that was a mistake) to a SJW not that long ago, she refused to believe I could have different viewpoints on things then her, often questioning me why.

"4527",141,"Gizortnik",20,2,140,7,0,"This isn't necessarily narcisism showing, but it's still an effect of the ideological totalism that the narcissists generate around them. It's not just that they're in an echo bubble, it's more of an echo dome. Everyone inside the dome talks about how they're glad that they're in this dome, because everyone else's domes are shittier. So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power. Been there, done that."

Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago. Another decade can pass, way more rights can be gained, and someone like her will still declare the world a shitty place.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

Don't be silly, that's not going to happen...... Marvel isn't getting a next phase, it just peters out after the next Avengers film, because people are only watching it now, because they are pot committed to see how the Thanos thing ends. 

Frankly if Thanos hadn't been teased in the earlier movies, they would have already opted out.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them. Because men are valued on their ability to **do** things, and boys generally can't get shit done, men will refer to themselves as men as soon as they can.

"4810",361,"Gizortnik",21,7,190,1,0,"&gt;Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

Remember that our brains have not yet had the chance to adapt to basically one generation of insane advances in the medical sciences.

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them. Because men are valued on their ability to **do** things, and boys generally can't get shit done, men will refer to themselves as men as soon as they can.

Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power.

Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."
"5093",643,"ThatDeviantOne",22,22,361,1,0,"This was insightful to me. Although I've seen how SJWs behave, I talked to very few of them myself to know my interaction would have gone the way it did.

&gt; No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.

&gt; No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.

Post infinity war will be the test. So many contracts will be up and heroes retired. What they do next can determine their success.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide.

Post infinity war will be the test. So many contracts will be up and heroes retired. What they do next can determine their success.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

&gt; No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.

&gt; No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.

Post infinity war will be the test. So many contracts will be up and heroes retired. What they do next can determine their success.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Come on, the worst sin in that Captain Marvel reboot was Civil War II. 

EDIT: I'm having a hard time expressing this, but it's really fucking frustrating to see Mike refer to a 48-year-old woman as ""a girl."" Would he call 49-year-old male comic book writer (say, Garth Ennis) a boy? "
"6158",3,"Kazia_Thornhill",26,1,2,69,0,"Captain Marvels been rebooted 7 times at least in a short amount of time. So I think that says something. "

"6160",127,"CaffeineFire",26,2,4,30,0,"I will never understand the industry fascination with Carol Danvers. She has always been a boring character. The writers and editors and artists have tried many times to make her more appealing: Costume change, drama, power-up, alcohol addiction. Nothing sticks. 

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."
"6161",534,"sinnodrak",26,15,127,31,0,"The most interesting thing Carol Danvers ever did was get her powers absorbed by Rogue, who is actually an interesting female character."

Why didn't Rogue ever have those powers?"
"6164",657,"reluttr",26,24,642,2,0,"Well Rouge did still have the energy absorbing power, just it wasn't a issue because she very rarely took off her gloves. She usually tried to use it as a Trump card to take down extra tough baddies, but it usually backfired because she would easily get overwhelmed. 

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

"6179",545,"MusRidc",26,15,2,1,0,"Probably because we place inherent value on women based on their ability to birth children. Younger women have a higher chance of producing healthy offspring, and have a higher chance of raising these children to adulthood before perishing themselves. Remember that our brains have not yet had the chance to adapt to basically one generation of insane advances in the medical sciences.

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them. Because men are valued on their ability to **do** things, and boys generally can't get shit done, men will refer to themselves as men as soon as they can.

Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you.

Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

Why didn't Rogue ever have those powers?"
"6455",657,"reluttr",27,24,642,2,0,"Well Rouge did still have the energy absorbing power, just it wasn't a issue because she very rarely took off her gloves. She usually tried to use it as a Trump card to take down extra tough baddies, but it usually backfired because she would easily get overwhelmed. 

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them. Because men are valued on their ability to **do** things, and boys generally can't get shit done, men will refer to themselves as men as soon as they can.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

Frankly if Thanos hadn't been teased in the earlier movies, they would have already opted out.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

Why didn't Rogue ever have those powers?"
"6746",657,"reluttr",28,24,642,2,0,"Well Rouge did still have the energy absorbing power, just it wasn't a issue because she very rarely took off her gloves. She usually tried to use it as a Trump card to take down extra tough baddies, but it usually backfired because she would easily get overwhelmed. 

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

Younger women have a higher chance of producing healthy offspring, and have a higher chance of raising these children to adulthood before perishing themselves. Remember that our brains have not yet had the chance to adapt to basically one generation of insane advances in the medical sciences.

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them. Because men are valued on their ability to **do** things, and boys generally can't get shit done, men will refer to themselves as men as soon as they can.

It's not just that they're in an echo bubble, it's more of an echo dome. Everyone inside the dome talks about how they're glad that they're in this dome, because everyone else's domes are shittier. So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power. Been there, done that."
"6828",190,"ThatDeviantOne",28,3,141,3,0,"That would certainly explain a lot. While all those things do exist, SJWs think they're far more common than they actually are. Yet these things are becoming a lot less common. Even a few years ago, gay marriage was made legal nation wide in America. Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago. Another decade can pass, way more rights can be gained, and someone like her will still declare the world a shitty place. ""But, there's still way more cisgender people than transgender people on TV"" or something like that."

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

Frankly if Thanos hadn't been teased in the earlier movies, they would have already opted out.

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.

&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

EDIT: I'm having a hard time expressing this, but it's really fucking frustrating to see Mike refer to a 48-year-old woman as ""a girl."" Would he call 49-year-old male comic book writer (say, Garth Ennis) a boy? "

"7034",127,"CaffeineFire",29,2,4,31,0,"I will never understand the industry fascination with Carol Danvers. She has always been a boring character. The writers and editors and artists have tried many times to make her more appealing: Costume change, drama, power-up, alcohol addiction. Nothing sticks. 

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."
"7035",534,"sinnodrak",29,15,127,34,0,"The most interesting thing Carol Danvers ever did was get her powers absorbed by Rogue, who is actually an interesting female character."

Why didn't Rogue ever have those powers?"
"7038",657,"reluttr",29,24,642,2,0,"Well Rouge did still have the energy absorbing power, just it wasn't a issue because she very rarely took off her gloves. She usually tried to use it as a Trump card to take down extra tough baddies, but it usually backfired because she would easily get overwhelmed. 

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."
"7039",687,"CaffeineFire",29,29,642,1,0,"That episode may be based on the comic, I'm not sure, but Carol Danvers was actually interesting and sympathetic in that episode and if they used that aspect of her in the comics then she could actually be fun to read about.

Remember that our brains have not yet had the chance to adapt to basically one generation of insane advances in the medical sciences.

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them. Because men are valued on their ability to **do** things, and boys generally can't get shit done, men will refer to themselves as men as soon as they can.

"7121",141,"Gizortnik",29,2,140,8,0,"This isn't necessarily narcisism showing, but it's still an effect of the ideological totalism that the narcissists generate around them. It's not just that they're in an echo bubble, it's more of an echo dome. Everyone inside the dome talks about how they're glad that they're in this dome, because everyone else's domes are shittier. So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power. Been there, done that."

Yet these things are becoming a lot less common. Even a few years ago, gay marriage was made legal nation wide in America. Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago. Another decade can pass, way more rights can be gained, and someone like her will still declare the world a shitty place.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

Now people are saying ""You have to go see Captain Marvel because it'll be crucial to understanding Endgame."" Fool me once... If Brie wants to make clear that I'm unwelcome as a viewer because of my genitals and the color of my skin, I'm happy to oblige."

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

Why didn't Rogue ever have those powers?"
"7334",657,"reluttr",30,24,642,2,0,"Well Rouge did still have the energy absorbing power, just it wasn't a issue because she very rarely took off her gloves. She usually tried to use it as a Trump card to take down extra tough baddies, but it usually backfired because she would easily get overwhelmed. 

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them. Because men are valued on their ability to **do** things, and boys generally can't get shit done, men will refer to themselves as men as soon as they can.

It's not just that they're in an echo bubble, it's more of an echo dome. Everyone inside the dome talks about how they're glad that they're in this dome, because everyone else's domes are shittier. So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power.

Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

Of course, people are all individuals, some people don't have the confidence or just are more modest, but ultimately it's a small number of bitter, fun-hating people who have such a PROBLEM with this, and of course people who've realized that sexual gratification is a need and gatekeeping people's access to their needs gives you power over them."

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

EDIT: I'm having a hard time expressing this, but it's really fucking frustrating to see Mike refer to a 48-year-old woman as ""a girl."" Would he call 49-year-old male comic book writer (say, Garth Ennis) a boy? "

"7626",127,"CaffeineFire",31,2,4,32,0,"I will never understand the industry fascination with Carol Danvers. She has always been a boring character. The writers and editors and artists have tried many times to make her more appealing: Costume change, drama, power-up, alcohol addiction. Nothing sticks. 

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."
"7627",534,"sinnodrak",31,15,127,32,0,"The most interesting thing Carol Danvers ever did was get her powers absorbed by Rogue, who is actually an interesting female character."

Why didn't Rogue ever have those powers?"
"7630",657,"reluttr",31,24,642,2,0,"Well Rouge did still have the energy absorbing power, just it wasn't a issue because she very rarely took off her gloves. She usually tried to use it as a Trump card to take down extra tough baddies, but it usually backfired because she would easily get overwhelmed. 

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them. Because men are valued on their ability to **do** things, and boys generally can't get shit done, men will refer to themselves as men as soon as they can.

It's not just that they're in an echo bubble, it's more of an echo dome. Everyone inside the dome talks about how they're glad that they're in this dome, because everyone else's domes are shittier. So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power. Been there, done that."
"7714",190,"ThatDeviantOne",31,3,141,5,0,"That would certainly explain a lot. While all those things do exist, SJWs think they're far more common than they actually are. Yet these things are becoming a lot less common. Even a few years ago, gay marriage was made legal nation wide in America. Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago. Another decade can pass, way more rights can be gained, and someone like her will still declare the world a shitty place.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."
"7716",643,"ThatDeviantOne",31,22,361,2,0,"This was insightful to me. Although I've seen how SJWs behave, I talked to very few of them myself to know my interaction would have gone the way it did.

Marvel at the time, lol) started giving her grief for being ""slutty Captain Marvel"".  One asked if she was really my girlfriend or I'd brought an escort.

If we take a look at fashion and women's clothing throughout the ages, there's always *some* issue that someone will think was/is problematic. In the 20s it was showing a little bit of skin. in the 60s-70s-80s it was the bra or tight fitting clothing. in the 90s-00s it was showing your thong whenever you'd bend over.

We women can never win, we will always hate ourselves/other women and we will shame one another for looking like we want to, and that's not even taking the ""male gaze"" into account.

It's ridiculous, but it's the truth. Jealousy and envy being projected onto others etc..

Sometimes if I wasn't there some jerk would grab her ass or say something lewd, but that tends to stop whenever a girl's boyfriend is around cuz people like that are cowards and don't wanna get punched.  But a bunch of people, like a little clique, just laying into her for like...having the temerity to wear something they disapproved of, that was bizarre, and it's not behavior either of us had seen before in geek culture or thought really happened here.

Of course, people are all individuals, some people don't have the confidence or just are more modest, but ultimately it's a small number of bitter, fun-hating people who have such a PROBLEM with this, and of course people who've realized that sexual gratification is a need and gatekeeping people's access to their needs gives you power over them."

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

"7926",657,"reluttr",32,24,642,2,0,"Well Rouge did still have the energy absorbing power, just it wasn't a issue because she very rarely took off her gloves. She usually tried to use it as a Trump card to take down extra tough baddies, but it usually backfired because she would easily get overwhelmed. 

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them.

So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power. Been there, done that."

Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."
"8012",643,"ThatDeviantOne",32,22,361,2,0,"This was insightful to me. Although I've seen how SJWs behave, I talked to very few of them myself to know my interaction would have gone the way it did.

In the 20s it was showing a little bit of skin. in the 60s-70s-80s it was the bra or tight fitting clothing. in the 90s-00s it was showing your thong whenever you'd bend over.

We women can never win, we will always hate ourselves/other women and we will shame one another for looking like we want to, and that's not even taking the ""male gaze"" into account.

Of course, people are all individuals, some people don't have the confidence or just are more modest, but ultimately it's a small number of bitter, fun-hating people who have such a PROBLEM with this, and of course people who've realized that sexual gratification is a need and gatekeeping people's access to their needs gives you power over them."

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

"8223",657,"reluttr",33,24,642,3,0,"Well Rouge did still have the energy absorbing power, just it wasn't a issue because she very rarely took off her gloves. She usually tried to use it as a Trump card to take down extra tough baddies, but it usually backfired because she would easily get overwhelmed. 

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them. Because men are valued on their ability to **do** things, and boys generally can't get shit done, men will refer to themselves as men as soon as they can.

So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power.

Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."
"8309",643,"ThatDeviantOne",33,22,361,2,0,"This was insightful to me. Although I've seen how SJWs behave, I talked to very few of them myself to know my interaction would have gone the way it did.

Judaism is an ethno-religion, they generally don't seek or even outright attempt to discourage converts and spread solely by family ties. Islam like Christianity is an evangelical religion seeking converts.

Of course there's a difference between Ashkenazi (European), Sephardi (Hispanic), Mizrahi (Middle-Eastern), &amp; Beta Israel (Ethiopian) Jews but that's the general idea."

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power.

Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

I'll get downvoted to hell, but I still don't understand how jews are seen as a race but muslims are seen as religious people. Maybe it's because I grew up in a country where we don't really get up in arms about religion or maybe it's because I'm ignorant idk.

Also Gal Gadot is so white looking it's laughable, she's one of the safest (and blandest) choices for Wonder Woman imo. I still can't believe they didn't go with a better actress, but wokeness factor counts for more points than an actual actress I guess."

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them.

Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power.

Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from.

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power.

Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

I'll get downvoted to hell, but I still don't understand how jews are seen as a race but muslims are seen as religious people. Maybe it's because I grew up in a country where we don't really get up in arms about religion or maybe it's because I'm ignorant idk.

Also Gal Gadot is so white looking it's laughable, she's one of the safest (and blandest) choices for Wonder Woman imo. I still can't believe they didn't go with a better actress, but wokeness factor counts for more points than an actual actress I guess."

Post infinity war will be the test. So many contracts will be up and heroes retired. What they do next can determine their success.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

The writers and editors and artists have tried many times to make her more appealing: Costume change, drama, power-up, alcohol addiction. Nothing sticks. 

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

"9411",657,"reluttr",37,24,642,3,0,"Well Rouge did still have the energy absorbing power, just it wasn't a issue because she very rarely took off her gloves.

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

&gt; A source. I need a source.

&gt; Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.

&gt; No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.

&gt; You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.

&gt; Do you have a degree in that field?

&gt; No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.

Post infinity war will be the test. So many contracts will be up and heroes retired. What they do next can determine their success.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Come on, the worst sin in that Captain Marvel reboot was Civil War II. 

EDIT: I'm having a hard time expressing this, but it's really fucking frustrating to see Mike refer to a 48-year-old woman as ""a girl."" Would he call 49-year-old male comic book writer (say, Garth Ennis) a boy? "

"9704",127,"CaffeineFire",38,2,4,33,0,"I will never understand the industry fascination with Carol Danvers. She has always been a boring character. The writers and editors and artists have tried many times to make her more appealing: Costume change, drama, power-up, alcohol addiction. Nothing sticks. 

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."
"9705",534,"sinnodrak",38,15,127,32,0,"The most interesting thing Carol Danvers ever did was get her powers absorbed by Rogue, who is actually an interesting female character."

"9707",642,"Slade23703",38,22,534,2,0,"Yes, I never heard of her when the X-Men cartoom dropped. I guessed due to Rogue;s power she was a Superman copy or something. When I heard she finally recovered and I heard she had energy absorbing powers, I was like what?

Why didn't Rogue ever have those powers?"
"9708",657,"reluttr",38,24,642,3,0,"Well Rouge did still have the energy absorbing power, just it wasn't a issue because she very rarely took off her gloves. She usually tried to use it as a Trump card to take down extra tough baddies, but it usually backfired because she would easily get overwhelmed. 

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."
"9709",687,"CaffeineFire",38,29,642,2,0,"That episode may be based on the comic, I'm not sure, but Carol Danvers was actually interesting and sympathetic in that episode and if they used that aspect of her in the comics then she could actually be fun to read about.

But then she wouldn't be a perfect princess, and we can't have that."

"9724",545,"MusRidc",38,15,2,1,0,"Probably because we place inherent value on women based on their ability to birth children. Younger women have a higher chance of producing healthy offspring, and have a higher chance of raising these children to adulthood before perishing themselves. Remember that our brains have not yet had the chance to adapt to basically one generation of insane advances in the medical sciences.

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them. Because men are valued on their ability to **do** things, and boys generally can't get shit done, men will refer to themselves as men as soon as they can.

Yes, it is sexist by definition, but there is very little you can do about it."

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"".

In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."

For example: before the new Star Wars trilogy, Disney put out a casting call for male actors in their 20s/30s and a female in her late teens/early 20s."

Don't be silly, that's not going to happen...... Marvel isn't getting a next phase, it just peters out after the next Avengers film, because people are only watching it now, because they are pot committed to see how the Thanos thing ends. 

Frankly if Thanos hadn't been teased in the earlier movies, they would have already opted out.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;

EDIT: I'm having a hard time expressing this, but it's really fucking frustrating to see Mike refer to a 48-year-old woman as ""a girl."" Would he call 49-year-old male comic book writer (say, Garth Ennis) a boy? "

"10001",127,"CaffeineFire",39,2,4,34,0,"I will never understand the industry fascination with Carol Danvers. She has always been a boring character. The writers and editors and artists have tried many times to make her more appealing: Costume change, drama, power-up, alcohol addiction. Nothing sticks. 

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

Why didn't Rogue ever have those powers?"
"10005",657,"reluttr",39,24,642,3,0,"Well Rouge did still have the energy absorbing power, just it wasn't a issue because she very rarely took off her gloves. She usually tried to use it as a Trump card to take down extra tough baddies, but it usually backfired because she would easily get overwhelmed. 

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."
"10006",687,"CaffeineFire",39,29,642,2,0,"That episode may be based on the comic, I'm not sure, but Carol Danvers was actually interesting and sympathetic in that episode and if they used that aspect of her in the comics then she could actually be fun to read about.

Remember that our brains have not yet had the chance to adapt to basically one generation of insane advances in the medical sciences.

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them. Because men are valued on their ability to **do** things, and boys generally can't get shit done, men will refer to themselves as men as soon as they can.

They freak the fuck out when you resist them in the slightest, attack you, then when you complain they shit all over you for complaining. They also think everyone thinks like them, that's why they are typically so god damned insane and think the world works in insane ways."
"10087",140,"ThatDeviantOne",39,2,139,7,0,"When I talked (that was a mistake) to a SJW not that long ago, she refused to believe I could have different viewpoints on things then her, often questioning me why. She probably thought I would have the same opinions on things because of my different minority statuses. Because it's not where she wants it to be, she refused to acknowledge any progress in things like LGBT rights even as I spelled them out to her. I got the vibe she was basically right on everything and had no room for being wrong."
"10088",141,"Gizortnik",39,2,140,11,0,"This isn't necessarily narcisism showing, but it's still an effect of the ideological totalism that the narcissists generate around them. It's not just that they're in an echo bubble, it's more of an echo dome. Everyone inside the dome talks about how they're glad that they're in this dome, because everyone else's domes are shittier. So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power. Been there, done that."
"10089",190,"ThatDeviantOne",39,3,141,5,0,"That would certainly explain a lot. While all those things do exist, SJWs think they're far more common than they actually are. Yet these things are becoming a lot less common. Even a few years ago, gay marriage was made legal nation wide in America. Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago. Another decade can pass, way more rights can be gained, and someone like her will still declare the world a shitty place. ""But, there's still way more cisgender people than transgender people on TV"" or something like that."

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."
"10091",643,"ThatDeviantOne",39,22,361,2,0,"This was insightful to me. Although I've seen how SJWs behave, I talked to very few of them myself to know my interaction would have gone the way it did.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

Why didn't Rogue ever have those powers?"
"10302",657,"reluttr",40,24,642,3,0,"Well Rouge did still have the energy absorbing power, just it wasn't a issue because she very rarely took off her gloves. She usually tried to use it as a Trump card to take down extra tough baddies, but it usually backfired because she would easily get overwhelmed. 

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them. Because men are valued on their ability to **do** things, and boys generally can't get shit done, men will refer to themselves as men as soon as they can.

It's not just that they're in an echo bubble, it's more of an echo dome. Everyone inside the dome talks about how they're glad that they're in this dome, because everyone else's domes are shittier. So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power. Been there, done that."

Yet these things are becoming a lot less common. Even a few years ago, gay marriage was made legal nation wide in America. Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago. Another decade can pass, way more rights can be gained, and someone like her will still declare the world a shitty place.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."
"10388",643,"ThatDeviantOne",40,22,361,2,0,"This was insightful to me. Although I've seen how SJWs behave, I talked to very few of them myself to know my interaction would have gone the way it did.

"10456",595,"sakura_drop",40,18,594,4,0,"Seriously, though. The predominantly female cosplay scene creates a real dissonance with this whole issue. Hell, not even cosplay: Halloween and general fancy dress costumes, too. 

Why is Harley Quinn such a monumentally popular dress up choice if so many women apparently find sexy scantily clad characters so problematic? And it ain't the Harley wearing the body suit; it's the one in the micro hotpants and ripped fishnets who looks like a hooker with a baseball bat."
"10457",596,"Aurondarklord",40,18,595,8,0,"Because most women DON'T find it a problem.  Most women love sex and nudity.  Media for women is full of sex and nudity.  Fathers go crazy from the day their daughters hit puberty trying to stop them from going to school wearing dental floss.  Women fantasize about being super attractive just like men do, and if they ARE, they love to show it off, just like men.

Of course, people are all individuals, some people don't have the confidence or just are more modest, but ultimately it's a small number of bitter, fun-hating people who have such a PROBLEM with this, and of course people who've realized that sexual gratification is a need and gatekeeping people's access to their needs gives you power over them."

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

EDIT: I'm having a hard time expressing this, but it's really fucking frustrating to see Mike refer to a 48-year-old woman as ""a girl."" Would he call 49-year-old male comic book writer (say, Garth Ennis) a boy? "

"10595",127,"CaffeineFire",41,2,4,35,0,"I will never understand the industry fascination with Carol Danvers. She has always been a boring character. The writers and editors and artists have tried many times to make her more appealing: Costume change, drama, power-up, alcohol addiction. Nothing sticks. 

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

Why didn't Rogue ever have those powers?"
"10599",657,"reluttr",41,24,642,3,0,"Well Rouge did still have the energy absorbing power, just it wasn't a issue because she very rarely took off her gloves. She usually tried to use it as a Trump card to take down extra tough baddies, but it usually backfired because she would easily get overwhelmed. 

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them. Because men are valued on their ability to **do** things, and boys generally can't get shit done, men will refer to themselves as men as soon as they can.

It's not just that they're in an echo bubble, it's more of an echo dome. Everyone inside the dome talks about how they're glad that they're in this dome, because everyone else's domes are shittier. So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power. Been there, done that."

Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago. Another decade can pass, way more rights can be gained, and someone like her will still declare the world a shitty place.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."
"10685",643,"ThatDeviantOne",41,22,361,2,0,"This was insightful to me. Although I've seen how SJWs behave, I talked to very few of them myself to know my interaction would have gone the way it did.

In the 20s it was showing a little bit of skin. in the 60s-70s-80s it was the bra or tight fitting clothing. in the 90s-00s it was showing your thong whenever you'd bend over.

We women can never win, we will always hate ourselves/other women and we will shame one another for looking like we want to, and that's not even taking the ""male gaze"" into account.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.

Because fundamentally there is nothing there that appeals to readers. And to put a boring actress into the role of a boring character is a double whammy this movie can't recover from. Even if the writing is good - which let's be honest, it's going to be mediocre at best - a pouty buzzkill like Brie Larson can't pull it off.

If Larson is going to be so toxic to men (the TARGET AUDIENCE) then perhaps they should do themselves a favor and skip out on this movie and wait until the next Avengers film. At least it will have a decent cast to carry her dead weight."

"10896",657,"reluttr",42,24,642,3,0,"Well Rouge did still have the energy absorbing power, just it wasn't a issue because she very rarely took off her gloves. She usually tried to use it as a Trump card to take down extra tough baddies, but it usually backfired because she would easily get overwhelmed. 

The only reason she kept CM's powers was because she gave her a *extra* hard sucking.

Also, no joke, when I was a kid I thought she was Storms daughter for the longest time. lol
I mean both could fly, both had similar builds with the thick flowing hair, plus storms white hair made her look older. Plus they always had each others back. Just seemed logical to my 7 year old self.

Personally, I'm hoping after this movie putters out they take a similar route with the movie universe. Rouge was a far more interesting character, and being reduced to a reoccurring nightmare of butt hurt vengeful spirit in someones head sounds like the *perfect* role for Brie Larson."

So because women are ""worth"" more to society when they're young, and a lot less once they hit menopause, they refer to themselves as ""girls"" for as long as people will humour them.

So when one ventures out into the world without a proper leash, they assume that they've just entered another dome. Your differences of opinion exist solely because you live in an entirely fictitious reality where transpeople are not murdered at staggering rates, black people aren't being genocided by the police, and men don't hate women. Pure fiction. Only an idiot would believe such lies, that's why they're smarter than you.

It's actually pretty standard in abusive environments. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, the idea of living in a non-abusive environment is *totally* alien to you. No one reacts to your triggers. No one panics because of small issues. And no one is competing with one another to give themselves an advantage with the sociopath or narcissist in power. Been there, done that."

Yet these things are becoming a lot less common. Even a few years ago, gay marriage was made legal nation wide in America. Sure it doesn't mean homophobia is over, but it's like that SJW I talked too didn't even want to admit that was in anyway a victory. Yes it can be argued the world is a shitty place, but not nearly as much compared to a decade ago. Another decade can pass, way more rights can be gained, and someone like her will still declare the world a shitty place.

This is not only a cornerstone of their ideological dogma, but it is also connected with their emotionally abusive environment. In psychology, it's referred to as ""problematizing"". In Postmodernism, the purpose of problematizing is to intentionally tear down a subject or issue and look at it explicitly as a problem to be fixed. In psychology, ""problematizing"" is basically a vernacular word describing a *cognitive distortion* that leads to psychopathological states. It is a combination of ""catastrophization"" and ""mislabling"".

Do you ever wonder why Jordan Peterson, repeatedly known as a clinical psychologist, is at odds with the post-modernists? It's not doctrinal (although he's enough of an intellectual to make that argument); it's practical. SJW-ism is emotional abuse. An entire political wing has industrialized emotional abuse as a form of political action.

Abuse victims can't normally see the world outside their cloistered and abusive environment. Their abusive environment has been crafted so that they are dependent on it, and they can't separate from it without trauma. This means that the outside world is going to be literally alien to them, and they have ingrained behaviors that will allow themselves to *maintain* being in an abusive environment. I know because I used to do this.

If you *ever* bring up a positive issue, the abuse victim can find a way to shit on it because they've learned that *everything* is actually something bad waiting to happen. Is it your birthday? Bad shit happens on your birthday, it'll all go wrong. You got a raise? That means your boss expects more work out of you and your stress is going to go up. Your wife says she loves you? She doesn't really love you, she just doesn't know any better. You're a fucking fraud.

I can do this all day.. oh wait, I used to do this all day for years on end. When you talk to someone with this attitude, it's worse than talking to a brick wall because a brick wall doesn't push back and condemn you for trying to talk to it.

When you do it to yourself, therapists and psychologists call it ""negative self-talk"". Psychologists and psychotherapists identify it as a cognitive distortions that lead it to behavioral problems and potentially serious mental health issues like depression and suicide. You know what Foucault (leading thinker of the postmodernist movement) called it? *Critical Thinking*."
"10982",643,"ThatDeviantOne",42,22,361,2,0,"This was insightful to me. Although I've seen how SJWs behave, I talked to very few of them myself to know my interaction would have gone the way it did.

I'll get downvoted to hell, but I still don't understand how jews are seen as a race but muslims are seen as religious people. Maybe it's because I grew up in a country where we don't really get up in arms about religion or maybe it's because I'm ignorant idk.

Also Gal Gadot is so white looking it's laughable, she's one of the safest (and blandest) choices for Wonder Woman imo. I still can't believe they didn't go with a better actress, but wokeness factor counts for more points than an actual actress I guess."

Judaism is an ethno-religion, they generally don't seek or even outright attempt to discourage converts and spread solely by family ties. Islam like Christianity is an evangelical religion seeking converts.

Of course there's a difference between Ashkenazi (European), Sephardi (Hispanic), Mizrahi (Middle-Eastern), &amp; Beta Israel (Ethiopian) Jews but that's the general idea."

In the 20s it was showing a little bit of skin. in the 60s-70s-80s it was the bra or tight fitting clothing. in the 90s-00s it was showing your thong whenever you'd bend over.

We women can never win, we will always hate ourselves/other women and we will shame one another for looking like we want to, and that's not even taking the ""male gaze"" into account.

Of course, people are all individuals, some people don't have the confidence or just are more modest, but ultimately it's a small number of bitter, fun-hating people who have such a PROBLEM with this, and of course people who've realized that sexual gratification is a need and gatekeeping people's access to their needs gives you power over them."

LOL there is no such thing as to big to fail. In fact big things not only fail, they fail all the time. In fact all things fail eventually, so I'm not sure why people keep on insisting some things are to big to fail.

Post infinity war will be the test. So many contracts will be up and heroes retired. What they do next can determine their success. 

Ghostbusters was just a shitshow bad movie. They mistook the negative reaction as people picking on them. 

Star Wars is just too narrow. Theres not a lot of potential in story - its vanilla good vs evil especially when you just focus it around the skywalkers. "

Again by the logic you present you basically saying the movie will make her a feminist loon ball and I am a bad parent BC I won't tell her no.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;lol. This is the dumbest comment section based on one of the dumbest articles I've read in months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel (AKA Monica Rambeau, yeah, that's right -- RAMBO, get over it) first appeared in October, 1982 in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #16. She eventually became the head of the Avengers, replacing another female character The Wasp. A mistake sapped her of her Super powers at one time, so she resigned. But she eventually regained them and has been the Leader of the Avengers, as well as other Super Hero teams in full or pro-tem capacity many times since then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, after Captain Marvel teamed up with Genis, the son of the original Mar-Vell, she offered the title ""Captain Marvel"" to him. He declined, but in respect to the original Mar-Vell (the Kriss warrior) she changed her Super Hero name to Photon. And there have been other changes. Monica Rambeau has been;  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Marvel  
Photon  
Daystar  
Spectrum  
&gt;  
&gt;And probably some I've missed or forgotten about because I haven't followed comics seriously since I graduated high school in 1979 and went on to college and then adult life.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the writer doesn't know any of this. He's just a pop-culture hack who doesn't even have a Wikipedia-level knowledge of Captain Marvel so he acts like Captain Marvel being a woman is annoying fans as if he had a clue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Son, she's been a woman since 1982. That's 37 years Captain Marvel has been a woman. And even I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is that nobody who is a Marvel fan cares that Captain Marvel is a woman. The name/title with many Marvel heroes is a transitory place holder and many characters assume the mantle. We all know this. Jean Grey has had many names. Phoenix. Dark Phoenix. Marvel Girl. Possibly some others that I've forgotten. Hacks don't know that. They think comic book universes are stamped in amber. They're not. They change, reboot, and do all kinds of interesting (and sometimes stupid and ill-thought-out) things.  
&gt;  
&gt;What Marvel fans care about is the character is so massively OP, like Jean Grey the most powerful and God-Like mutant, that her presence will Mary Sue the The End Game.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the author doesn't know that either. He's too busy getting it wrong for woke points.
