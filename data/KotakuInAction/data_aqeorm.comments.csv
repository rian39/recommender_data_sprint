I said something along the lines of ''Tencent just bought 150mil in reddit so it's starting.''

Got downvoted really fast and had someone saying that it was only 150M over a total of 2B. So clearly the only way China has to takeover or get access is an immediate hostile takeover. Otherwise it's just no problems at all. No thinking about why tencent would even invest in rediit. "
