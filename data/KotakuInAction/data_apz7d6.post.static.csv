"1","ScatterYouMonsters","[SocJus] How Social Justice Ideologues Hijacked a Legal Regulator (Canada)","Thought I'd do a thread on this... not sure if it passes anymore, but hey, might as well try lol. Basically, the writer of this article is a ""progressive"" and ""egalitarian"" that believes in social justice and diversity, and he listed a bunch of examples of his work to back it up, including:

&gt; I am a recipient of the Diane Martin Medal For Social Justice Through Law, the Human Rights Award from the Ontario Federation of Labour, and the Champion of Justice Award from Aboriginal Legal Services of Toronto. In 2014, and again in 2015, Canadian Lawyer Magazine put me on its national Top-25-Most-Influential list because of my advocacy on behalf of those seeking access to justice.

However, it seems some more radical people have been taking over. To quote:

&gt; In Canada, the legal profession is regulated provincially. Seven years ago, the Law Society of Ontario (which then was still called the Law Society of Upper Canada) created a working group to address challenges faced by racialized licensees in Ontarios legal profession. The working group reported in 2016 that it had discovered systemic racism in the profession. While no one will dispute that elements of racism can be found in parts of Canadian society, the collected survey data did not support the conclusion that racism in my profession is widespread and serious. Nevertheless, in December, 2016, Convocation (the legislative body that governs the Law Society) adopted a set of 13 recommendations on the topic. Times being what they are, no one felt comfortable putting the brakes on this process, despite misgivings. The idea that racism was rampant, and that heavy-handed measures were required to address it, took on a life of its own.

&gt; One of the listed recommendations was that the Law Society should require every licensee to adopt and to abide by a statement of principles acknowledging their obligation to promote equality, diversity and inclusion generally, and in their behaviour towards colleagues, employees, clients and the public. When the Law Society announced this new requirement the following September, its advisory also stated that we Ontario lawyers should demonstrate a personal valuing of these principles.

&gt; Despite the fact that I always have been a strong advocate for equality, this development left me flabbergasted: Our regulator was demanding that lawyers and paralegals draft and then obey a set of specific political ideasboth in their personal and professional livesas a condition of their license. Failure to prepare a personal statement of principles in keeping with the Law Societys directive would likely result (after a short reprieve for re-education) in sanctions, such as an administrative suspension. (The Law Society has not formally announced what the penalty will be, except to say that progressive measures would be applied.) Lawyers who are suspended are not permitted to practice law. Their refusal to embrace these values would put their livelihood in peril. The Law Society was prescribing, effectively with the force of law, what to say and what to think. I never imagined that I would ever see such a thing in Canada.

He talks about himself a bit &amp; his ancestors, then continues by saying how compelling speech is unconscionable, and so forth:

&gt; Compelling speech is unconscionable regardless of the principles a person is made to parrot. Today, we are being told to promote equality, diversity and inclusion. But once this line has been crossed, the content doesnt matter. And tomorrow, we might be asked to pledge allegiance to some other ideological doctrine.

&gt; I believe in treating people as equals. I have always tried to be colour-blind. That does not mean ignoring a persons background or disrespecting it. It can mean trying to help to offset any disadvantage they may have faced. But that is not what the Law Society means by equality. According to the new lexicon, treating people as humans of equal worth is considered unequal. Instead, they must be treated as numbers in a ledger, contributors to a quota.

And, imo, that's an issue. Because the people today - sjws, intersectionals, etc - they don't believe in color blindness. That was (obviously) the case from the start, but they didn't have the numbers. And now they do. Remember, color blindness is racism. We should also keep in mind, similar things are happening - to a degree - in US: ""[Better promote 'diversity,' 'inclusion' if you want tenure at this Ohio college](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=11728)""

Anyway...

&gt; To many Quillette readers, this perversion of language may not come as a surprise. I have been late to this party, and perhaps I have been naïve about how ideology has corrupted the ideal of social justice and the words we use to describe it. The Law Societys working group declared that one of its objectives was to ensure better representation of racialized licensees, in proportion to the representation in the Ontario population, in the professions, in all legal workplaces and at all levels of seniority. Note the specificity of this objective. Every lawyer and paralegal is now expected to adopt and promote racial representation according to proportion in the general population in all legal workplaces and at all levels of seniorityan enforced mosaic or grid of de facto quotas in vertical and lateral compartments based, essentially, on skin colour.

&gt; But if the proportion of some skin colours and ethnicities is too low, then the proportion of others must be too high. And while the authors of these rules no doubt would be quick to deny this plain corollary, the arithmetic truth is plain as a matter of simple logic. Without having the nerve to say so directly, the Law Society is telling us that there are, in effect, too many white Jewish lawyersfor there is no single group that has had more success, on a per capita basis, in gaining representation in the Ontario legal market. (The Law Society also has determined that the same rule shall apply to all equality-seeking groups, but shrewdly avoided the awkward step of explaining what these are. And it may be assumed that the list of such groups will expand continually according to ideological fashion.)

&gt; As an egalitarian and progressive, I always have been favourably inclined toward diversity and inclusion. But I thought those ideas meant a spirit of open-mindedness and respect toward others regardless of their personal characteristics. In fact, that is the opposite of what the Law Society means and intends. In this context, diversity and inclusion is code for identity politicsby which we are all slotted into factions defined by appearance, ethnicity and gender (usually through self-identification), supposed antagonists in an altogether imaginary and endless zero-sum game of dominance and oppression.

&gt; That is a world I do not recognize. I know well that Canadian society includes many people who are disadvantaged and require help. In some cases, these disadvantages do indeed have some connection to group identity. I have dedicated my career to such causes. That does not mean that we are defined by our ethnicities or that we are locked in a group-on-group struggle for power.

And so forth. He also says what he did when it became clear what was happening:

&gt; When it became clear that the diversity faction had captured my professions regulators, I felt I had no choice. My first step was to tell the Law Society to, in effect, go to hell. I did so in a long letter, to which I have not yet received a reply. The second step was to refuse to comply with the new requirement. (The Law Society announced that there would be penalties for such failure, though not during the first yearso, thus far, I still have my license.) The third was to wind down my law firm, because I no longer feel that my legal practice is viable in this climate. The fourth was to join in a court challenge to the compulsory Statement of Principles, which is ongoing. Finally, I have joined a group of other lawyers and paralegals who oppose the Statement of Principles and who are organizing a campaign in the upcoming Law Society elections in April. In a surprising development, I will be running for Bencher (the somewhat quaint term used to describe the Law Societys directors), with the goal of changing the Law Society from the inside.

&gt; I realized that all of these steps would have reputational consequences for my firm. My opposition to the new rules would create serious internal conflict with my younger associates, who might either agree with the new policy or seek to avoid the notoriety associated with opposing it. My conflict with the Law Society also would become known to my clients, my professional contacts, potential recruits who are still in law school, and my wider circle of progressive friends and supporters. I feared that the principled nature of my stance would be lost on many of these people, who would simply see my efforts as being aimed at undermining the goals of equality, diversity and inclusion. Given all this, I believed that I had no choice but to wind down the firm.

And, this is a perfect example why terms such as those matter (and less so what's truly behind them). It goes on for some while, and:

&gt; The directors of the Law Society are democratically electedwhich offers us some hope and opportunity. This pushback has to start somewhere. If lawyers, of all people, cannot defend themselves against tyranny, then what use are we to anyone?
