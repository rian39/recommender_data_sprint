"133",25,"Wonder_Buster",7,5,1,1,0,"It's like watching a trainwreck and the conductor wants the train to speed up. The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

"518",9,"Wonder_Buster",15,1,1,16,0,"It's like watching a trainwreck and the conductor wants the train to speed up. The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

Then again, with X-Men back in the picture, that opens a whole lot of awesome female heroes...."

"609",9,"Wonder_Buster",16,1,1,18,0,"It's like watching a trainwreck and the conductor wants the train to speed up. The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

"709",9,"Wonder_Buster",17,1,1,19,0,"It's like watching a trainwreck and the conductor wants the train to speed up. The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.

Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie.

Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

"815",9,"Wonder_Buster",18,1,1,20,0,"It's like watching a trainwreck and the conductor wants the train to speed up. The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

As for outrage at the marketing, I'm not outraged. I'm completely ambivalent on CM. I am not a comic reader and the only things I know are the middling trailer and what I've heard about her comics.

I find the ""wahmen are strongz and only bigots will hate this film"" stuff usually a signal the film isn't very good. Black Panther had some of that going into it and it wasn't bad but it wasn't a great film. It was very average. 

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh. 

I post in these areas because I find it funny when corporations shit on their primary demographic in order to pander to an audience that doesn't really exist."

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

A) Wonder Woman didn't need it to succeed.

B) The lead is not the ""woke"" kind of feminist and tends to be the kind to piss off the woke feminists.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

"923",9,"Wonder_Buster",19,1,1,19,0,"It's like watching a trainwreck and the conductor wants the train to speed up. The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.

"1032",8,"Wonder_Buster",20,1,1,22,0,"It's like watching a trainwreck and the conductor wants the train to speed up. The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

As for outrage at the marketing, I'm not outraged. I'm completely ambivalent on CM. I am not a comic reader and the only things I know are the middling trailer and what I've heard about her comics.

I find the ""wahmen are strongz and only bigots will hate this film"" stuff usually a signal the film isn't very good. Black Panther had some of that going into it and it wasn't bad but it wasn't a great film. It was very average. 

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

A) Wonder Woman didn't need it to succeed.

B) The lead is not the ""woke"" kind of feminist and tends to be the kind to piss off the woke feminists.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

So you keep running your mouth Brie, simple fact is, the end to your story is already written. The more you piss people off the faster you become Rogue chow. Keep acting like a bitch and your 15 minutes of fame could literally be 15 minutes."

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).

Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.

B) The lead is not the ""woke"" kind of feminist and tends to be the kind to piss off the woke feminists.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.




Brie Larson might suck, and Captain Marvel might suck, but I also thought Antman, Thor and Dr Strange and Ironman would suck and wound up enjoying them. So who knows, I won't see this in theaters but I might pirate it for sure if reviews from people are good."

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.

"2135",8,"Wonder_Buster",29,1,1,25,0,"It's like watching a trainwreck and the conductor wants the train to speed up. The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

B) The lead is not the ""woke"" kind of feminist and tends to be the kind to piss off the woke feminists.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

"2214",102,"IWantToTalkNow-",30,16,98,5,0,"Im not a big comics person at all, but maybe my point of view will help.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

Then again, with X-Men back in the picture, that opens a whole lot of awesome female heroes...."

I don't read the comics, but [the second image here was spreading around a few years ago](https://twitter.com/msmarvelnow/status/795407364610465793)...  It's basically all I know of her."
"2216",132,"IWantToTalkNow-",30,18,131,1,0,"Eh, non-surprising.  Still like the character, even with that.  I just see her as a sort of do-gooder teen who idolizes a known hero.  Gives me a spider-man vibe, so hopefully the character can be saved from that crap.  It also attracts me because I had a Pakistani friend growing up who was totally split between his regular life (school, friends, eventually work) and his family life (turned into a totally different person), and I remember early on reading she had that aspect to her character around.  I hope it works out well, if it doesnt, so be it."

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.




Brie Larson might suck, and Captain Marvel might suck, but I also thought Antman, Thor and Dr Strange and Ironman would suck and wound up enjoying them. So who knows, I won't see this in theaters but I might pirate it for sure if reviews from people are good."

I find the ""wahmen are strongz and only bigots will hate this film"" stuff usually a signal the film isn't very good. Black Panther had some of that going into it and it wasn't bad but it wasn't a great film. It was very average. 

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

A) Wonder Woman didn't need it to succeed.

B) The lead is not the ""woke"" kind of feminist and tends to be the kind to piss off the woke feminists.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.

"2387",8,"Wonder_Buster",31,1,1,28,0,"It's like watching a trainwreck and the conductor wants the train to speed up. The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh. 

I post in these areas because I find it funny when corporations shit on their primary demographic in order to pander to an audience that doesn't really exist."

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

"2542",197,"Duotronic93",32,27,196,3,0,"I agree with you... which is why the outrage shit is happening with this film and not Wonder Woman.

A) Wonder Woman didn't need it to succeed.

B) The lead is not the ""woke"" kind of feminist and tends to be the kind to piss off the woke feminists.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

"2639",8,"Wonder_Buster",33,1,1,27,0,"It's like watching a trainwreck and the conductor wants the train to speed up. The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

B) The lead is not the ""woke"" kind of feminist and tends to be the kind to piss off the woke feminists.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

"2718",102,"IWantToTalkNow-",34,16,98,5,0,"Im not a big comics person at all, but maybe my point of view will help.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

Then again, with X-Men back in the picture, that opens a whole lot of awesome female heroes...."

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie.

Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

Then again, with X-Men back in the picture, that opens a whole lot of awesome female heroes...."

I don't read the comics, but [the second image here was spreading around a few years ago](https://twitter.com/msmarvelnow/status/795407364610465793)...  It's basically all I know of her."

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.




Brie Larson might suck, and Captain Marvel might suck, but I also thought Antman, Thor and Dr Strange and Ironman would suck and wound up enjoying them. So who knows, I won't see this in theaters but I might pirate it for sure if reviews from people are good."

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

B) The lead is not the ""woke"" kind of feminist and tends to be the kind to piss off the woke feminists.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).

Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.

"3017",8,"Wonder_Buster",36,1,1,25,0,"It's like watching a trainwreck and the conductor wants the train to speed up. The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

As for outrage at the marketing, I'm not outraged. I'm completely ambivalent on CM. I am not a comic reader and the only things I know are the middling trailer and what I've heard about her comics.

I find the ""wahmen are strongz and only bigots will hate this film"" stuff usually a signal the film isn't very good. Black Panther had some of that going into it and it wasn't bad but it wasn't a great film. It was very average. 

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

A) Wonder Woman didn't need it to succeed.

B) The lead is not the ""woke"" kind of feminist and tends to be the kind to piss off the woke feminists.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

Then again, with X-Men back in the picture, that opens a whole lot of awesome female heroes...."

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie.

Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

B) The lead is not the ""woke"" kind of feminist and tends to be the kind to piss off the woke feminists.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

I don't read the comics, but [the second image here was spreading around a few years ago](https://twitter.com/msmarvelnow/status/795407364610465793)...  It's basically all I know of her."
"3480",132,"IWantToTalkNow-",40,18,131,1,0,"Eh, non-surprising.  Still like the character, even with that.  I just see her as a sort of do-gooder teen who idolizes a known hero.

It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.




Brie Larson might suck, and Captain Marvel might suck, but I also thought Antman, Thor and Dr Strange and Ironman would suck and wound up enjoying them. So who knows, I won't see this in theaters but I might pirate it for sure if reviews from people are good."

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

B) The lead is not the ""woke"" kind of feminist and tends to be the kind to piss off the woke feminists.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

B) The lead is not the ""woke"" kind of feminist and tends to be the kind to piss off the woke feminists.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

"3732",102,"IWantToTalkNow-",42,16,98,7,0,"Im not a big comics person at all, but maybe my point of view will help.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.  As a fan/moviegoer/etc, all I want is cool shit that I *want* to watch again later.

Then again, with X-Men back in the picture, that opens a whole lot of awesome female heroes...."

I don't read the comics, but [the second image here was spreading around a few years ago](https://twitter.com/msmarvelnow/status/795407364610465793)...  It's basically all I know of her."
"3734",132,"IWantToTalkNow-",42,18,131,1,0,"Eh, non-surprising.  Still like the character, even with that.  I just see her as a sort of do-gooder teen who idolizes a known hero.  Gives me a spider-man vibe, so hopefully the character can be saved from that crap.  It also attracts me because I had a Pakistani friend growing up who was totally split between his regular life (school, friends, eventually work) and his family life (turned into a totally different person), and I remember early on reading she had that aspect to her character around.  I hope it works out well, if it doesnt, so be it."

The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.




Brie Larson might suck, and Captain Marvel might suck, but I also thought Antman, Thor and Dr Strange and Ironman would suck and wound up enjoying them. So who knows, I won't see this in theaters but I might pirate it for sure if reviews from people are good."

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

A) Wonder Woman didn't need it to succeed.

B) The lead is not the ""woke"" kind of feminist and tends to be the kind to piss off the woke feminists.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.

I basically stopped reading comics around 2000.  So lots of history over the 19 years since, Im sure.  That said, I always saw Captain Marvel as a fluff type character.  Cool powers, big morals, cool story... but meh.  Just never caught my attention, and if I wanted to see powers like hers, I really liked Nova.  I liked his costume better, his powers better, I was more familiar with him.  Civil War?  Just read what people wrote online, summaries, etc.  Just didnt catch on to Captain Marvel, period.  Seemed like they were trying too hard, maybe?   Idk.

And, I barely look at comic stuff maybe once every few months.  But yknow what?  Miss Marvel?  I hella wanna see a movie for her.  Kamala Khan Miss Marvel.  Cool powers, teenager, neat outfit, idolizes Captain Marvel (if I get that right :P).  Idk if her comics are social justice-y, probably, but even if thats the case, I still want to see her on the MCU big screen.  Also, Squirrel Girl pls, because that would be too epically awesome.  Scarlett Witch movie that has a serious tone and deals with mental health stuff and her fucked up experiences done MCU style?  Take my money, etc.  

The point Im getting at is this:  Captain Marvels got the cool outfit, cool powers, but other than that just doesnt connect.  She doesnt even rank in the top 10 most popular female marvel characters.  Now, if her movie hits on all cylinders, or even most, then Im happy to switch camp and become a fan.  But why not take any of the other more popular female characters?  Even I can think of a bunch, and I barely get into this stuff, JRPGs are my thing.

"3906",8,"Wonder_Buster",43,1,1,26,0,"It's like watching a trainwreck and the conductor wants the train to speed up. The possibility of Disney jumping the shark by creating a deus ex machina or a one on one fight with Thanos would have severe implications. It would suddenly make Marvel movies as uncool as Star Wars is now, the entire fanbase will accept Avengers: Infinity War as the true end of the MCU, and the fans are going to stay away from Marvel movies in droves. It's possible that Disney may wind up with two dead franchises - Marvel and Lucasfilm - and essentially leave Disney in a worse state than in the 1970s - mid 1980s.

I think it's a huge ass warning sign that we haven't seen a trailer for Episode IX for Star Wars, even to the point where they miss a prime opportunity to advertise it during the Super Bowl. The fact that it *might* debut alongside either Captain Marvel or Endgame doesn't change the fact that the Star Wars movie is setting up to be one of the worst box office bombs in the history of cinema, because of how Lucasfilm pissed off it's fanbase.

In case you're wondering how this relates to Captain Marvel - well, it has **EVERYTHING** to do with it. Once word of mouth got out about the unsatisfactory plot, there was a huge ass dropoff for The Last Jedi in comparison to The Force Awakens. This bad word of mouth, coupled with Lucasfilm's doubling and tripling down on their inferior product and insulting their fanbase, was the catalyst that saw the Han Solo spinoff to lose at least $200 million USD, and I would not be surprised if Episode IX's losses are around the same amount, if not more. Making Captain Marvel the literal deus ex machina that winds up resolving the 11 year buildup Marvel had made is going to tank future superhero projects for the studio, and fans may jump ship to DC out of spite for Marvel going for a resolution only a small fraction of the viewerbase wants.

I don't think that this is a radical idea that Disney may see itself at a crossroads. Their live action section is rehashing their old animated works, a huge emphasis on sequels in the animated department, Lucasfilm is in shambles already and Marvel may have the same fate based on the decisions made in Endgame. It may be an example of Disney growing too big too fast, and paying for it dearly in the long term.

In layman's terms, if I was a Disney investor, I'd be worrying my ass off right now."

LOL calm down bro. Endgame plot leaked on 4chan a few months ago and is being confirmed with leaked toy packaging and promotional images.

Captain Marvel is not going to solo Thanos. Antman, pym particles and the quantum realm are more important to the story.


Captain Marvel just hangs out with Captain America the whole time, they have good buddy moments and her part of the movie is essentially Captain America passing his torch to Captain Marvel the same way Tony Stark is passing his torch to Spider-man.

I find the ""wahmen are strongz and only bigots will hate this film"" stuff usually a signal the film isn't very good. Black Panther had some of that going into it and it wasn't bad but it wasn't a great film. It was very average. 

I might see Captain Marvel but only after reviews drop. I saw BP because his performance in Civil War was great. I have nothing to base my judgement on CM beyond the actors involved (and I think Brie Larson is a decent actress, she did well on Community) and the promo material which looks meh.

This is the key-NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT CAPTAIN MARVEL. They have been pushing her in comics hard for the past ten years but her series keep getting cancelled due to low sales, and her character is BAD and constantly changes.


Very few people care about the Captain Marvel movie. Disney is manufacturing fake controversy in order to try and draw up excitement for this movie that no one is actually looking forward to and that isn't very good. Their plan might work and it might not. Who knows! I hope the film is good, I hope it proves me wrong! But it doesn't look like that's going to be the case.



I will be captain obvious and make the prediction that this film is going to get amazing critic reviews and poor to middling audience reviews. Then everyone who writes a poor review will be branded a misogynist troll my Disney-controlled media outlets, and review sites will start deleting negative CM reviews under the excuse that they are trolling.

B) The lead is not the ""woke"" kind of feminist and tends to be the kind to piss off the woke feminists.

The reason why this riles some people up is not that CM is a sacred cow they don't want ruined on screen, it's the potential collapse of the MCU which people are invested in.
