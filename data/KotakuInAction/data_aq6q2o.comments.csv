"28",28,"TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK",1,1,27,-24,0,"Well, think about it this way. Twitch the company has two options.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "
"29",29,"Anti-ism",1,1,28,25,0,"That's the false choice the censors want you to believe it is though. It's not ""slurs are bad"" vs. ""slurs are ok"" it's ""nanny state"" vs. ""freedom of choice"". If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned. 

And that takes us back to the original comment, that the internet has become a place for Adult Children. Because a real grown-up adult doesn't need someone else to solve every slight that comes their way."

Or, more likely, they would not pass any exams to a university, and lead a life of some unskilled worker, reflecting their actual level of development. They would not be hailed as heroes. You can claim a lot of things about communism, but saying that what you have now is like the spores of USSR spawning elsewhere is beyond ridiculous.

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is. 

I'm convinced at this point that SJWs are just people who were never loved as children and so they have no idea how to distinguish between play and real aggression. They're literally mentally underdeveloped. "

Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

"657",28,"TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK",3,1,27,-31,0,"Well, think about it this way. Twitch the company has two options.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "
"658",29,"Anti-ism",3,1,28,32,0,"That's the false choice the censors want you to believe it is though. It's not ""slurs are bad"" vs. ""slurs are ok"" it's ""nanny state"" vs. ""freedom of choice"". If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned. 

And that takes us back to the original comment, that the internet has become a place for Adult Children. Because a real grown-up adult doesn't need someone else to solve every slight that comes their way."
"659",30,"TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK",3,1,29,-17,0,"So again: either make all gay people feel welcome (even and especially the ones who dislike homophobic slurs) or instead design it for people who are okay with those slurs.

This has nothing to do with freedom of choice and everything to do with the kind of people Twitch is designing their platform for. "
"660",31,"TheSeaISail",3,1,28,12,0,"\3. Evaluate cases in their context and not conflate harassing a homosexual person and calling them a faggot with getting angry at a stranger on the internet and calling them a faggot.

One of those things deserves a suspension the other deserves a ""please refrain from that behavior on our platform"" warning. "
"661",32,"TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK",3,1,31,-15,0,"That's a distinction without a difference, though. You're still using a homophobic slur that makes gay people feel unwelcome on the Twitch platform. "
"662",33,"TheSeaISail",3,1,32,8,0,"&gt;You're still using a homophobic slur that makes gay people feel unwelcome on the Twitch platform. 

You speak for all of them?

And I didn't say there'd be no consequences. My point was that Twitch should take the context into account and give a warning rather than a suspension if it's clearly not being used in a homophobic context.

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get.

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

"988",28,"TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK",4,1,27,-30,0,"Well, think about it this way. Twitch the company has two options.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "
"989",29,"Anti-ism",4,1,28,34,0,"That's the false choice the censors want you to believe it is though. It's not ""slurs are bad"" vs. ""slurs are ok"" it's ""nanny state"" vs. ""freedom of choice"". If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned. 

And that takes us back to the original comment, that the internet has become a place for Adult Children. Because a real grown-up adult doesn't need someone else to solve every slight that comes their way."
"990",30,"TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK",4,1,29,-20,0,"So again: either make all gay people feel welcome (even and especially the ones who dislike homophobic slurs) or instead design it for people who are okay with those slurs.

"991",418,"MishtaMaikan",4,4,30,1,0,"I don't care that people say ""faggot"". Why pretend to speak on behalf of all gays To enact censorship?

And I didn't say there'd be no consequences. My point was that Twitch should take the context into account and give a warning rather than a suspension if it's clearly not being used in a homophobic context.

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

"1329",28,"TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK",5,1,27,-31,0,"Well, think about it this way. Twitch the company has two options.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "
"1330",29,"Anti-ism",5,1,28,35,0,"That's the false choice the censors want you to believe it is though. It's not ""slurs are bad"" vs. ""slurs are ok"" it's ""nanny state"" vs. ""freedom of choice"". If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned. 

And that takes us back to the original comment, that the internet has become a place for Adult Children. Because a real grown-up adult doesn't need someone else to solve every slight that comes their way."

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get.

Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually.

Twitch is in the process of making the ads part of the stream to prevent ad blockers from working. Also Amazon Prime linked to become Twitch Prime no longer prevents new users from seeing ads. Anyone who already had it will start to see ads the next time their subscription to Amazon Prime renews.

It's not because being retarded or gay is bad, it's because they're not any of those things. A person with an IQ greater than 80 shouldn't be acting like someone with an IQ of 60. Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is. 

I'm convinced at this point that SJWs are just people who were never loved as children and so they have no idea how to distinguish between play and real aggression. They're literally mentally underdeveloped. "

"2048",28,"TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK",7,1,27,-31,0,"Well, think about it this way. Twitch the company has two options.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "
"2049",29,"Anti-ism",7,1,28,32,0,"That's the false choice the censors want you to believe it is though. It's not ""slurs are bad"" vs. ""slurs are ok"" it's ""nanny state"" vs. ""freedom of choice"". If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned. 

And that takes us back to the original comment, that the internet has become a place for Adult Children. Because a real grown-up adult doesn't need someone else to solve every slight that comes their way."
"2050",30,"TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK",7,1,29,-24,0,"So again: either make all gay people feel welcome (even and especially the ones who dislike homophobic slurs) or instead design it for people who are okay with those slurs.

"2051",418,"MishtaMaikan",7,4,30,1,0,"I don't care that people say ""faggot"". Why pretend to speak on behalf of all gays To enact censorship?

"2053",31,"TheSeaISail",7,1,28,12,0,"\3. Evaluate cases in their context and not conflate harassing a homosexual person and calling them a faggot with getting angry at a stranger on the internet and calling them a faggot.

One of those things deserves a suspension the other deserves a ""please refrain from that behavior on our platform"" warning. "
"2054",32,"TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK",7,1,31,-17,0,"That's a distinction without a difference, though. You're still using a homophobic slur that makes gay people feel unwelcome on the Twitch platform. "
"2055",33,"TheSeaISail",7,1,32,8,0,"&gt;You're still using a homophobic slur that makes gay people feel unwelcome on the Twitch platform. 

You speak for all of them?

And I didn't say there'd be no consequences. My point was that Twitch should take the context into account and give a warning rather than a suspension if it's clearly not being used in a homophobic context.

Discourage use of the word instead of dropping the ban hammer, you know, behave like adults?"
"2056",34,"TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK",7,1,33,-4,0,"No, but neither do you, and banning someone who uses a homophobic word seems like a pretty simple and elegant solution.

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get.

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

Gay meant lame, fag generally meant someone obnoxious or uncool. When Billy called Jake in 7th grade a fag, he was not calling him a homosexual. Even thinking to the N word, if its a bad word, NOBODY should be able to use it.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

Twitch is in the process of making the ads part of the stream to prevent ad blockers from working. Also Amazon Prime linked to become Twitch Prime no longer prevents new users from seeing ads. Anyone who already had it will start to see ads the next time their subscription to Amazon Prime renews.

In effect, Twitch is trying very hard to shill their Twitch Turbo (another $9 a month service that will block ads on Twitch) or force everyone to watch ads."

"2856",83,"kelley38",9,1,70,21,0,"""Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. Weak men create hard times"" - G Michael Hopf, *Those Who Remain*

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

"3167",28,"TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK",10,1,27,-34,0,"Well, think about it this way. Twitch the company has two options.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "
"3168",29,"Anti-ism",10,1,28,40,0,"That's the false choice the censors want you to believe it is though. It's not ""slurs are bad"" vs. ""slurs are ok"" it's ""nanny state"" vs. ""freedom of choice"". If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned. 

And that takes us back to the original comment, that the internet has become a place for Adult Children. Because a real grown-up adult doesn't need someone else to solve every slight that comes their way."
"3169",30,"TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK",10,1,29,-22,0,"So again: either make all gay people feel welcome (even and especially the ones who dislike homophobic slurs) or instead design it for people who are okay with those slurs.

"3175",34,"TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK",10,1,33,-3,0,"No, but neither do you, and banning someone who uses a homophobic word seems like a pretty simple and elegant solution.

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is. 

I'm convinced at this point that SJWs are just people who were never loved as children and so they have no idea how to distinguish between play and real aggression. They're literally mentally underdeveloped. "

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get.

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

It's not because being retarded or gay is bad, it's because they're not any of those things. A person with an IQ greater than 80 shouldn't be acting like someone with an IQ of 60. Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is. 

I'm convinced at this point that SJWs are just people who were never loved as children and so they have no idea how to distinguish between play and real aggression. They're literally mentally underdeveloped. "

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "
"5985",102,"Anti-ism",17,1,101,40,0,"That's the false choice the censors want you to believe it is though. It's not ""slurs are bad"" vs. ""slurs are ok"" it's ""nanny state"" vs. ""freedom of choice"". If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned. 

And that takes us back to the original comment, that the internet has become a place for Adult Children. Because a real grown-up adult doesn't need someone else to solve every slight that comes their way."

And I didn't say there'd be no consequences. My point was that Twitch should take the context into account and give a warning rather than a suspension if it's clearly not being used in a homophobic context.

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is. 

I'm convinced at this point that SJWs are just people who were never loved as children and so they have no idea how to distinguish between play and real aggression. They're literally mentally underdeveloped. "

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

If I had a tin-foil hat on, I'd probably say that was why General Patton died in a tragic car accident in Germany shortly after the war ended.

Or, more likely, they would not pass any exams to a university, and lead a life of some unskilled worker, reflecting their actual level of development. They would not be hailed as heroes. You can claim a lot of things about communism, but saying that what you have now is like the spores of USSR spawning elsewhere is beyond ridiculous.

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "
"6826",102,"Anti-ism",19,1,101,43,0,"That's the false choice the censors want you to believe it is though.

If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "
"7253",102,"Anti-ism",20,1,101,41,0,"That's the false choice the censors want you to believe it is though. It's not ""slurs are bad"" vs. ""slurs are ok"" it's ""nanny state"" vs. ""freedom of choice"". If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

Twitch is in the process of making the ads part of the stream to prevent ad blockers from working. Also Amazon Prime linked to become Twitch Prime no longer prevents new users from seeing ads. Anyone who already had it will start to see ads the next time their subscription to Amazon Prime renews.

In effect, Twitch is trying very hard to shill their Twitch Turbo (another $9 a month service that will block ads on Twitch) or force everyone to watch ads."

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get.

Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

Twitch is in the process of making the ads part of the stream to prevent ad blockers from working. Also Amazon Prime linked to become Twitch Prime no longer prevents new users from seeing ads. Anyone who already had it will start to see ads the next time their subscription to Amazon Prime renews.

In effect, Twitch is trying very hard to shill their Twitch Turbo (another $9 a month service that will block ads on Twitch) or force everyone to watch ads."

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it).

Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is. 

I'm convinced at this point that SJWs are just people who were never loved as children and so they have no idea how to distinguish between play and real aggression. They're literally mentally underdeveloped. "

Jews that survived the holocaust have said that if Nazis could be reasoned with, they would have went that route, but they couldnt. Preaching and attempting to spread genocide IS VIOLENCE.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

They don't think they'll lose the core appeal of the platform, and a contingent of users will rise to defend their actions no matter what.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

I see people saying oh, well if hes gay he has a gay pass. Thats hypocritical, if the words bad, nobody should be getting passes, but thats exactly where the hypocrisy lies."

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "
"9453",184,"Anti-ism",25,1,183,45,0,"That's the false choice the censors want you to believe it is though.

If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it).

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

Jews that survived the holocaust have said that if Nazis could be reasoned with, they would have went that route, but they couldnt. Preaching and attempting to spread genocide IS VIOLENCE.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

They don't think they'll lose the core appeal of the platform, and a contingent of users will rise to defend their actions no matter what.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is. 

I'm convinced at this point that SJWs are just people who were never loved as children and so they have no idea how to distinguish between play and real aggression. They're literally mentally underdeveloped. "

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "
"10794",184,"Anti-ism",28,1,183,46,0,"That's the false choice the censors want you to believe it is though.

If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

Twitch is in the process of making the ads part of the stream to prevent ad blockers from working. Also Amazon Prime linked to become Twitch Prime no longer prevents new users from seeing ads. Anyone who already had it will start to see ads the next time their subscription to Amazon Prime renews.

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get.

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

It's not because being retarded or gay is bad, it's because they're not any of those things. A person with an IQ greater than 80 shouldn't be acting like someone with an IQ of 60. Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is. 

I'm convinced at this point that SJWs are just people who were never loved as children and so they have no idea how to distinguish between play and real aggression. They're literally mentally underdeveloped. "

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

Looking at your post history shows youre into being racist, homophobic, and kinkshaming and thats with a cursory glance. Youre right, you fit in here.

Jews that survived the holocaust have said that if Nazis could be reasoned with, they would have went that route, but they couldnt. Preaching and attempting to spread genocide IS VIOLENCE.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

Twitch is in the process of making the ads part of the stream to prevent ad blockers from working. Also Amazon Prime linked to become Twitch Prime no longer prevents new users from seeing ads. Anyone who already had it will start to see ads the next time their subscription to Amazon Prime renews.

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it).

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get.

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline.

It's not because being retarded or gay is bad, it's because they're not any of those things. A person with an IQ greater than 80 shouldn't be acting like someone with an IQ of 60. Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is. 

I'm convinced at this point that SJWs are just people who were never loved as children and so they have no idea how to distinguish between play and real aggression. They're literally mentally underdeveloped. "

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it).

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

Looking at your post history shows youre into being racist, homophobic, and kinkshaming and thats with a cursory glance. Youre right, you fit in here.

Jews that survived the holocaust have said that if Nazis could be reasoned with, they would have went that route, but they couldnt. Preaching and attempting to spread genocide IS VIOLENCE.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

1: it can permit homophobic slurs and alienate gay users, or

2: it can disallow homophobic slurs and alienate people who really strongly believe that homophobic slurs should be allowed

In that scenario, the choice seems pretty obvious, right? After all, the vast majority of people don't really care either way, so it's a minority of people who will be impacted by this decision. And of the people impacted, ""slurs are bad"" wins against ""slurs are OK actually"". "

If you're offended by the use of those slurs, you're free to watch a different channel with someone who doesn't use those slurs. If you're not, you continue watching. It's not even ""alienate gay users vs. anti-gay users"". I know plenty of homosexuals who aren't offended by that language (one uses it himself and laughs when people are shocked about him using it). And there's plenty of people who would be offended by that language, but not in one-off situations or occasional usage. Because they're not so thin-skinned.

Some of this is a philosphical (the Everyone-Gets-A-Trophy mentality creating grown adults who can't deal with the reality of failure or stife), but some is just simple evolution as well. 

Imagine all the beta males you know trying to survive as little as 200 years ago. Working all day, hard labor, for anything and everything they get. Being on the razor's edge of survival from day to day, just one single bad harvest from their family starving during the coming winter. Survival of the fittest weeded those worthless wastes of oxygen out of the gene pool. 

Now, with modern technology and medicine, they flourish. Modern society sees those of us with the balls to make it in life, without the government handing anything to us, as an anachronism, as toxic, as harmful. This is actually nothing new though. Look at the fall of the Roman Empire. Look at the Mongolian Empire after Kublai Khan. Look at the end of the Edo Period in Japan. Look at pre-WW1 era Europe. All times and places of great wealth, great power followed by a softening of the men in the culture, and then a drastic decline. The fall will come, and life will suck (comparatively) but life will go on. With luck, our children will see the error of our ways and right the sinking ship.

Someone with an IQ of 60 can't help that they were born that way, so it's rude to insult them for it. 

Same thing with gay people.  The idea behind it is that you don't want people to think you're gay if you're not actually gay. You want to keep the record straight because evolutionarily speaking, if you're straight, you want to maintain a certain sexual reputation. There's a part in the back of your mind that keeps track of other people's perception of you, and if there's a chance that women might ignore you because they think you're gay, then you avoid it naturally. It's not a conscious thing. Some people take it too far and then connect the idea of not being gay with the idea of ""gay equals bad."" 

But just look at most social interactions you have. I'm a straight white male and I call my friends retarded and faggots all the time. But when I actually see someone getting made fun of for being retarded or gay, I get angry. There's nothing wrong about being born a certain way. 

Just look into the psychological research on the Play mechanism. Animals and humans that are played with when they're young learn how to play for the rest of their lives. My dog play fights with me all the time. He barks at me, bares his teeth, and will put his mouth around my entire arm, and yet the whole time he never bites down or moves fast enough to pierce my skin. I similarly will grab him and push him, but not too roughly. How do we know how to do that? It's literally in our brains. They've found this mechanism in most mammals actually. We have the ability to play act, and the play looks very similar to the real deal. It's what humor is. It's what games are. It's what banter is.

Twitch is in the process of making the ads part of the stream to prevent ad blockers from working. Also Amazon Prime linked to become Twitch Prime no longer prevents new users from seeing ads. Anyone who already had it will start to see ads the next time their subscription to Amazon Prime renews.

I have less than no interest in changing the opinions of people on the Internet.

I have a great interest in finding like minded individuals, like the people on KIA. I believe that most of us here understand that the ""punch a Nazi"" crowd is incredibly dangerous.

Looking at your post history shows youre into being racist, homophobic, and kinkshaming and thats with a cursory glance. Youre right, you fit in here.

The old classic both sides are bad false equivalency where one side is saying literally kill all brown people and jews and the other is saying how about you dont do that and we wont let you . Yeah, so dangerous and totally equal /s

Jews that survived the holocaust have said that if Nazis could be reasoned with, they would have went that route, but they couldnt. Preaching and attempting to spread genocide IS VIOLENCE. Punching a nazi is defense of self/others. Meanwhile, youre in here literally defending nazis, and lacking any and all empathy for their victims.

But again, changing the subject because you lost the argument. Deadmau5 is a homophobic piece of trash. "
