After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.

&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

It just seems extremely odd to me that so many people just can't see what is completely obvious to my eyes. Sometimes it makes me wonder how different it makes me from SJWs who see everything as attempts at oppressing them, and whether or not I'm objectively looking at the world. Especially when I see confirmation that my beliefs are true and accurate nearly everywhere I look, just like they do.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

The article gives substantial weight behind the argument posited by the author in the OP title. But if you like a TL;DR:

&gt;Are we to believe that while prominent figures on the left encourage uncivil and even violent tactics, both on an [off college campuses](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-antifa-protesters-caught-on-video-bullying-elderly-motorist-woman-in-wheelchair), their online behaviour is, with the solitary exception of Rose McGowan, universally exemplary?  
&gt;  
&gt;Harassment and the advocacy of violence are serious issues, and there is nothing morally objectionable about social media companies removing this kind of content from their platforms. However, such laudable objectives should not be used as cover to prosecute ideological campaigns. While social media platforms are private companies, anti-discrimination laws generally allow legislators avenues to address businesses that exhibit unacceptable biases in how they treat the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unthinkable that we would allow a telephone or electricity company to prevent those on one side of the political aisle from using its services. Why would we allow social media companies to do the same?

Also, this tidbit:

&gt;Indeed, it is not difficult to find cases of liberals engaging in speech that appears to cross the line while not being punished for their transgressions. This includes the case of Sarah Jeong. After she was hired as an editorial writer for*The New York Times*, it was discovered that [over the years she had posted](https://archive.li/HkjeX/380642e32a080fe927e44643374a0411f565a995.jpg?retry=1) dozens of messages expressing hatred and contempt of whites. When conservative activist Candace Owens copied some of Jeongs tweets and replaced the word white with Jewish, [she was suspended](https://archive.li/o/SDo33/https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/5/candace-owens-mimics-sarah-jeong-gets-suspended-tw/) from the platform. Perhaps realizing how hypocritical this looked after they had not taken any action against Jeong, Twitter allowed Owens back on, but only after she deleted the offending tweets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, if you search Sarah Jeong in Google, you get no auto-complete suggestions regarding her controversial tweets, despite this being the source of considerable infamy. On Bing and Yahoo!, Sarah Jeong racist is the first offered search suggestion when her name is typed in. While one could argue that individuals worst moments shouldnt follow them around forever, it is difficult to imagine a big tech company suppressing unflattering information about a conservative in a similar manner.

Of 22 prominent, politically active individuals who are known to have been suspended since 2005 and who expressed a preference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, 21 supported Donald Trump."
"1995",110,"TheJayde",28,12,7,3,0,"Sure, but they will claim causation.  It will become evidence that Trump followers are racist, because the rules are just so good that they were banned for that."

"1998",50,"jvardrake",28,7,16,24,0,"In what way?  That's the ""beauty"" of being in near total control of all mainstream media, and social media platforms: you can minimize, or completely make stories negative to ""your side"" just *go away*.

You think CNN is going to heavily focus on this, or even mention it at all?  You think Google is going to put this on people's homepages when they open a new browser window, or even have it show up in anywhere near the top of someone's sear results, when they search for a subject related to this?  You think Twitter is going to put this on its ""For You"" page?

A story like this will be picked up, and heard by people like you and I - people that already share this view.  The people on the other side, and - most importantly - those in the middle, won't even hear about it.

People really - *really* - need to start getting more worried about ceding near total control of ""the narrative"" to the left.  Our education system, mainstream media, social media, pop entertainment: everything that gets a message out to people is all controlled by the left.  They've been tightening their grip on all of this recently, and it's only going to get more and more aggressive in the lead up to November 2020."

Indeed, and why? Because they want to make sure that nothing like Trump ever happens again."
"2000",69,"Adamrises",28,8,51,6,0,"Considering Trump has done almost nothing to clamp down on voter fraud and get some form of security against it, its almost certainly not going to happen again.

That's the only ace they need, and they already have it, they just need to up the scale a little more and make sure people are distracted from it."
"2001",52,"Stormcrownage",28,7,50,5,0,"Oh I agree that the article itself is going to get ignored.

I was more commenting on how the author can now look forward to all sorts of unpleasantness for suggesting that conservatives are people too."
"2002",26,"curry_ist_wurst",28,5,1,23,0,"It's not just twitter though. These past few years, slowly but surely, I've seen the tone shift to the point that even being a conservative and admitting to such is enough to earn downright hostility from the woke brigade. It's gone from ""people with different political opinions"" to ""right wingers are all downright nazis and racists"" and what not. Heck even being in the center as I am is enough to get you labelled as a bigot in many cases.

One ""thing"" if it can be considered as such is that words like racist, sexist, misogynist etc have almost lost all meaning thanks to these people."

Censorship of the right is objectively an issue whether you agree with it or not. And it has nothing to do with the alt-right.
