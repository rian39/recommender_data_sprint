"1","Hotdogmaniac7","Why does Nintendo draw so many SJWs towards it?","Now yes, Sony and maybe even Microsoft have drawn them also, but Ive seen this with Nintendo more than the others. I mainly saw it when Fire Emblem started to get popular. They would take characters like Lucina or Lyn and have them wear shirts saying Not Your Waifu all while being drawn in their stupid Tumblr art style. It just pisses me off that they are infesting a company that I hold near and dear.","https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/aqcr44/why_does_nintendo_draw_so_many_sjws_towards_it/?ref=search_posts"
