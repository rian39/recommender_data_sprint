If the lawsuit was about infringing on freedom of expression, that would probably fail because Twitter is a private organization and they are free to censor whomever they want, at least until they are legally ruled to be like some sort of public utility or virtual public space.

But this suit is not about freedom of speech, it is an Unfair Competition claim. She's basically accusing Twitter of false advertising because Twitter claims they don't consider political viewpoints in their enforcement decisions, even though that's obviously untrue.

I don't know what that unfair competition claim applies to a free Internet platform which, despite its ubiquity, is probably not considered a monopoly. It sounds a little dicey to me, but IANAL.

If the lawsuit was about infringing on freedom of expression, that would probably fail because Twitter is a private organization and they are free to censor whomever they want, at least until they are legally ruled to be like some sort of public utility or virtual public space.

But this suit is not about freedom of speech, it is an Unfair Competition claim. She's basically accusing Twitter of false advertising because Twitter claims they don't consider political viewpoints in their enforcement decisions, even though that's obviously untrue.

I don't know what that unfair competition claim applies to a free Internet platform which, despite its ubiquity, is probably not considered a monopoly. It sounds a little dicey to me, but IANAL.

If the lawsuit was about infringing on freedom of expression, that would probably fail because Twitter is a private organization and they are free to censor whomever they want, at least until they are legally ruled to be like some sort of public utility or virtual public space.

But this suit is not about freedom of speech, it is an Unfair Competition claim. She's basically accusing Twitter of false advertising because Twitter claims they don't consider political viewpoints in their enforcement decisions, even though that's obviously untrue.

I don't know what that unfair competition claim applies to a free Internet platform which, despite its ubiquity, is probably not considered a monopoly. It sounds a little dicey to me, but IANAL.
