Throwaway, obviously. I also made the [same post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/af5h58/tifu_by_finding_out_ive_been_accidentally_dating/) over at r/TIFU.

I just found out a few hours ago and my girlfriend and I are currently a mental wreck. 

Quick background

My girlfriend (I'll refer to her as Sarah) and I have been dating for a little over than a year and our relationship has been going very well. We both happen to come from the same town and met each other in college after being introduced by a mutual friend of ours.

Last year for Christmas, Sarah decided to come over and stay with me at my apartment for the holidays. I also had decided not to go home for the holidays either. Plus, all my other roommates were back home visiting family, so we had the whole place to ourselves. It was perfect. 

Christmas day rolls around, and Sarah had bought the both of us 23andme DNA kits. The thing is, is that we were both conceived by in-vitro fertilization via sperm donors. Both of our fathers were infertile so our parents had no choice. Deep down, the both of us were hoping to find our biological fathers through the service.

Fast forward less than a month later to today, and both of our results are in. Sarah comes over to spend the weekend and we go through our results together on our laptops. We compare our ancestry and health reports and nothing seems off. I even found out I'm 2% Native American. All was well until we arrived at the ""DNA relatives"" section...

Sarah tightly holds my hand and says ""I hope we both find our fathers"". Then I open mine up....

At the top of my screen, I see Sarah's name.... ""27% DNA shared...half-sister..........""

Sarah starts hysterically laughing and tells me to stop joking. 

I don't react to anything she says, and just stare at my screen in disbelief. 

I then abruptly grab her laptop and open up her ""DNA relatives"" section. We see the same thing. My name at the top... ""27% DNA shared...half-brother"" 

At this moment my brain just completely short-circuits.....

I'VE BEEN HAVING SEX WITH MY HALF-SISTER. HOLY FUCKING SHIT. WTF

My mind starts going a 100mph and I began hyperventilating, going into a state of shock. I can't even remember what Sarah was doing at this time.

It's pretty self-explanatory by now, but for those of you who don't understand how we could be related, it turns out our moms were probably both fertilized by the same sperm sample. What are the fucking odds, right? The fact that we're from the same town certainly increased the odds but still. 
 
6 hours later, just typing this entire post makes my body shiver. There are no words I have to express what my mental state is now. To put it in simple words: I feel traumatized. Part of me still won't stop thinking about how much I love Sarah and then I realize our entire relationship was incest. I honestly feel disgusted standing in my own skin. I've even been contemplating suicide.

Sarah and I haven't talked at all since going into shock. 

Right as I'm finishing up this post, Sarah has grabbed her stuff and left my apartment a few moments ago.

I'm probably not going to respond to any of your comments/questions and I honestly want to be left alone in the corner of my room. I really just needed a place to vent all this.

TL;DR: Former gf and I are both sperm donor babies and come from the same town. We take a 23andme DNA test and find out we're each other's half-sibling. Meaning I've been having sex with my sister for over a year. Turns out we both were conceived from the same sperm sample, go figure.

I do not give permission for my post to be used in the making of any movie, story, book, etc. 

EDIT: My mates just came home and are giving me support. 

EDIT 2: RIP inbox. Thank you all so much for the support. I just logged back in and didn't really expect this post to blow up. Last night was rough. Sarah's friend/roommate called letting me know Sarah was home. As of now, Sarah and I still haven't talked. But after an night of thinking, I believe I've come to terms with what we've discovered. For those of you who still think this is fake (I honestly wish it was), here's a screenshot showing our shared DNA (https://i.imgur.com/Z0zm9xi.png). I think the best way for Sarah and I to heal is to go back home (our town) and see how this all began with our families. Only then will we be able to accept the reality. I'll post more updates as things develop.",363,2019-01-12 16:04:02,af5eex,2881,23andme has just shown that I've been accidentally dating my half-sister,https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/af5eex/23andme_has_just_shown_that_ive_been_accidentally/

"Hi guys. I've been lurking here for a bit, seeing other people's 23andMe experiences. I've seen lots of interesting stories re: parents not being parents. I figured I'd share my nuts story that finally was resolved this week through parental phasing.

I was born and grew up in Appalachian north Georgia, in a very homogeneously-ethnic area (I think, right now in 2019, it's still 97% white and the census only shows something like 600 people that identify as non-white in my entire home county, so imagine what it looked like in the mid-1980s.) All of my grandparents and great-grandparents are white Southerners of British/Irish or German descent. When I was born, I came out looking.... well, nothing like any of them. Namely, I looked very Asian. Looking at baby photos now, it's obvious and kind of hilarious, but somehow everyone just rationalized it away. I went through school with people making Asian jokes because I was in gifted classes and good at math and played instruments, etc, and I was derogatorily got called ""Chink"" and ""Oriental"" and ""Jap"" often (rural South with lots of racists, remember.) Oddly, it didn't really affect me at all, because I really just thought ""Man. These people are so dumb. I'm not even Asian lol"" My brother was born two years after me and he came out with blonde hair and pale skin, and no one questioned it haha. And to be fair, my parents were both sort of olive-skinned and dark-haired, so we didn't look SO radically different that it was completely implausible.

Flash forward to last year, and I buy two AncestryDNA tests because it was on sale and at that point, I hadn't really done any research. I bought it mostly because my spouse is 50/50 mixed race and we were curious what his would be like, fully expecting mine to be just generic Irish or something. I get the results, open them and it's like...  ""SURPRISE! You're 27% East Asian!"" (this was before Ancestry broke that huge category down into specific countries.) So I'm like ""WTAF?"". I call my mom, whom I have a very poor relationship with, and after some prodding finally she says ""OK, fine. I married your father when I was pregnant and I wasn't exactly being monogamous at 18 years old, so yeah, it's very possible that Man X is your biological dad."" Man X is a super redneck, homophobic piece of shit that I know a little about, so I don't want to contact him directly. So I send a Facebook message to his son and I'm like ""Hey, this is going to sound strange but do you have any Asian relatives?"" And he's like ""Yup! My grandma was 100% Japanese!"" Which, mathematically, would make sense for me to then be roughly 25% Japanese. So I'm like ""Ahhhh. That solves the mystery!"", because again, there are no other Asians that I know of in my hometown. And as it turns out, people in my hometown had suspected this was my biological father for years and openly discussed it without letting me know, including his kids, because his son is like ""BROTHER! Welcome to the family!"" and has his siblings all add me on FB, which is all very weird and I just kind of let it simmer for a minute to process.

Flash forward to earlier this year, and I decide to compare my results to 23andMe because everyone kept telling me how much they preferred it. My results come in and again I'm 25.3% Japanese. But on the relatives list, there's a woman listed as my aunt who is definitely not the sister of Man X/presumed dad, and her daughter is listed as my first cousin. So then, I'm super confused. I see she still lives in my hometown, so I ask some folks back home if they know her and they all say ""Oh yeah. She's wonderful. Just message her. She'll be cool."" I send her a message and she's super nice and actually thinks the whole thing is kind of hilarious and, as it turns out, her mother was \*also\* 100% Japanese. And she has two brothers. Eventually, she determines that ""I don't think it's this one brother, he's ultra-religious and probably too old to be your Dad, but it could be this other one, Man Y."" I chat with that brother for a bit on Facebook and after a few weeks and deciding they're not horrible people, I'm like ""If I send you a 23andMe test, would you take it?"" And he says ""Of course!"" At the same time, I tell my mom about this person and she's like ""Absolutely impossible. It's either your real dad or Man X. Nobody else. I don't even know who that is"", even though they went to HS and graduated together. As it turns out, the families of Man X and Max Y were both close, because their mothers were both Japanese immigrants who had married US servicemen after the Korean war and moved to my tiny ass hometown in rural Georgia.

His results came in this week and indeed, Man Y is my biological father. He's super apologetic for ""not  being there"" and I'm like ""No apology! I have a great life and you couldn't have known."" What's weird is that my mom \*still\* insists that it's not possible, although that denial has become less emphatic this week. I'm also grateful that Man X, the inexplicably-racist-despite-being-50%-Asian and rabidly-homophobic dude is not my Dad. But yeah, everyone now is like all trying to process the news and what we do form here. Perhaps a little morbid but, thankfully, the father that raised me passed away a few years ago so I don't have to have this awkward conversation with him at least.

**TL:DR: My mom found the only two half-Asian men in my hometown, banged them both, then married my very non-Asian dad.

"That one simple word is how I feel, but it is still an understatement. I’m sitting in my car right now trying to get myself together. I don’t think I’ve ever been as pissed off and hurt as I am right now.

I found out how AY is related to me. Back when my mom was 16 and dad was 17, they had a daughter they put up for adoption. They explained to me that they didn’t have the resources to provide for a child at the time and they had even considered doing the same with me even though they were married when they conceived me. They were poor, as I previously mentioned in a comment reply. At this point, I was still really confused. She’d be 38 now, not 18 like AY stated. This is the kicker and why my parents are now divorcing...

When my older sister who was put up for adoption turned 18, she came looking for my parents and found them. They had a good relationship with each other, and then one day she randomly disappeared and cut all contact when she was 20. They had no idea why, or just my mom had no idea, rather.

I told my parents about a match I had on 23andme (after showing them my ancestry and then relatives, specifically AY) and my dad looked like he’d just seen a ghost. He didn’t talk for a minute, but then he told the truth and I almost wish he hadn’t. He admitted he screwed it up by sleeping with his own daughter and AY is the result of them having sex. All of those “business trips” I had mentioned in a comment weren’t fucking business trips. He would go visit her and they’d fuck, even right before my mom’s father passed away. He went to the hospital to be with my sister so he could support her and she gave the baby up for adoption and claimed she didn’t know who the father was, thinking my mom wouldn’t question anything about his whereabouts since she was too worried about her sickly dad. That’s what he was busy doing. I’m disgusted right now and I want to vomit.

I haven’t even spoken to my cousin or aunt or anyone else and quite frankly I’m not sure I’d like to, knowing this information. I have already messaged AY and told her the truth, because that’s what she deserves. Poor girl. She’s suffering physically from my dad and sister’s terrible choice, and probably emotionally and mentally too. Looking at her profile picture again, she and I look really similar. What do I even call her? My niece? My half sister? Both?? I don’t even know what to think right now. Sometimes things are better left alone. I learned this the hard way.

"Hi, guys! Saw all these posts about people finding their sperm donors and long lost relatives so I thought I'd share my story. 

All my life, I've been painfully aware how different I look compared to my parents and the rest of my family. My parents are both Japanese immigrants to the United States. They look very traditionally Japanese with black hair, monolidded eyes, and darker complexion. However, I have brown hair, pale skin, and large eyes(sauce eyes vs. Soy sauce eyes according to my parents). They insisted I was 100% Japanese and that my features were just a mutation. Even when I was little, I spidey sensed bullshit.  I never felt completely Japanese even though I speak Japanese and was raised Japanese. I just felt so strange. In a ethnically monogamous and kind of exclusive community, looking different will definitely make you feel a bit isolated. 

When I was 10, my mother passed away from ALS and all of a sudden I didn't have a mom. My dad became depressed from the toll of having to take care of her for years and the burden of watching her slowly die and he withdrew emotionally. When I was 14, he finally told me that I had actually been conceived via IVF. It felt like this giant plot hole in my life had been solved, finally. He told me that she was half Korean and half white and that she had been in her early twenties when she donated. 

I immediately started doing research. I found out that the fertility program they had used no longer existed so I called the hospital anyways and asked if I could access my mother's records. The lady on the phone was very understanding and did as much as she could. (Shoutout to Jane, btw) unfortunately, I could only access the records with my brothers signature along with mine but my brother was studying abroad at the time. 

Fast forward to when I'm 19, and I decide to take a DNA test to find out what ethnicity I am. [Ethnicity results here](https://i.imgur.com/clZlNxz.jpg) 
I am also surprisingly 12.8% Ashkenazi Jewish. 
When I look for relatives it connects me with someone who shares 49.8% DNA with me. ""This person is probably your mother"". Huh. 
I'm absolutely shocked. 

I send her a message asking if she donated eggs in the 90s and I get a response back saying she did!

We start messaging back and forth and I found she is single, no kids, and lives on the east coast. She turns out to be a lot like me. We even look alike! 

She turns out to be an amazing person. I finally got to ask her all the burning questions I've had since I was very little. I tell my brother and my father and my dad is immediately very supportive and asks her to visit us all the way on the west coast. 

Meeting her was amazing. We immediately clicked and when I saw her for the first time it was like something finally came together in fate and there was a sense of familiarity. It took my brother a little bit to warm up to her but soon they got along and went kayaking together. She has flipped my life upside down and got my depressed ass ready to be an adult. 

There is an understanding between everyone that she is not replacing my birth mother. My dad even has a theory that my mother set this up to happen so that we would finally have a mother. It feels like fate in a way? We are very similar and there are many uncanny parallels in our lives. Anyways, just wanted to share this with you guys.

I ordered myself and my dad a kit when they were on sale and we received our results a couple days ago. My mother has never really been interested in genealogy or DNA stuff so I didn’t tell her about it. The first thing my dad and I did was compare our “Ancestry Composition” and I noticed it was a bit... *off* to say the least. He is highly British & Irish (most strongly connected to the UK) with a small bit of French & German. I am mostly Scandinavian (most strongly connected to Sweden) with over a quarter French & German and some Italian. I then went to DNA Relatives and... you guessed it. He didn’t pop up on mine and I didn’t pop up on his. There *was* a **half sibling** (sharing 26.3%) and **father** match however. I began freaking out and my dad got so angry. My mom came home and he confronted her about it. She lost it and admitted she knew I was some other man’s child all along and would’ve tried to stop us had she known we got the tests. :( They are now divorcing which sucks. He’s now wondering if my two younger siblings are his or not.,268,2018-05-12 02:55:50,8iq8hu,494,My parents are now divorcing because of my results :(,https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/8iq8hu/my_parents_are_now_divorcing_because_of_my_results/
"Yeah, so I'm the woman who found out my abusive mother isn't really my mother. So, I can't say much right now but yes, I was the victim of custodial kidnapping and bio mom and her family ended up contacting me. They seem nice and were pretty happy to facetime with me and DW, didn't seem to care that I'm gay or anything. But it still feels really weird and surreal - it's so weird talking to complete strangers and knowing that they're your family.

&#x200B;

My real birth certificate from the hospital - not the fancy paper with the prints meant for hanging up on a wall (the one I have) - is in her possession so at least I know my name is the same. The being declared dead so far as we know is still just a clerical error and likely because several people have the same first and last name that I do - especially in the northeast. They never asked to have me declared dead, they were still hoping to find me. I can't say much else because police and attorney's are involved, apparently this happens a lot more than I thought it did.

First things first, just wow. I can't thank you all enough for the support through the kind comments and messages. I wish I could reply to all of them, but there are just too many.

I'll answer some common questions I received towards the end of the post, but I'll first start with where we left off.

After a long dreadful night full of surprises, I woke up the next morning questioning everything. I called bullshit on the test and immediately called Sarah. She picks up telling me she's already booked an appointment with a Genetic counselor. Good, we're both on the same page.

The next day, we meet with the genetic counselor specifying in patients who take tests with commercial companies. TLDR of what she said was, while the Ancestry reports can be interpreted with a degree of skepticism, DNA matches are determined directly through the raw DNA data, meaning the connection is either there or it isn't. We asked if there was a possibility that we contaminated each other's samples. She said that our samples would have been flagged by the system (apparently that's easy to spot). Even if our 'contaminated' samples magically made it through the system, we would have been shown to be sharing completely identical segments, while 23andme showed we only share half identical segments.

It was basically confirmed by a specialist at this point and the same feeling of dread I had the other night began to set in again. My friend called an hour later, telling Sarah and I to upload our raw data to a 3rd party dna site online, as extra confirmation. We did just that, and surprise surprise, we're shown as being half-siblings.

Sarah and I spent the rest of the day calling both of our parents and explaining everything. We all came to the conclusion of Sarah and I taking a weekend trip back home, to see how this all started. This idea came to me the same night when the whole ordeal began.

Ever since that night, Sarah and I, understandably, haven't been the same. I've been trying to mentally cope with my emotions. The logic part of me is telling me ""Incest bad, not right, break up"" while emotionally, I still love Sarah. I'm having this constant battle in my head, and I'm sure Sarah is too. All of this was especially apparent when Friday rolled around. We both packed our bags and hopped into my car. During our ENTIRE drive up North towards home, not a single fucking word from the both of us. 5 hours later, we finally made it to Sarah's house (the agreed meeting destination). Right before we exit the car, my brain decides to short-circuit. I grab Sarah's hand and lean into kiss her. She stops me, looks me in the eyes, and after brief pause while teary-eyed says ""No matter what the outcome of all this will be, I'll be leaving having gained a brother."" That shit hit me HARD. We both hug each other and start crying. For the first time in nearly a week, I felt some kind of relief while simultaneously thinking ""WTF is going on"". Sarah and I both being the emotional meat bags we are, stop hugging and head inside before one of us mentally breaks down (again).

2 hours later my parents arrive, and we all sit down and formally meet for the first time. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention how this is the first time both my parents and I are meeting Sarah's family? Imagine how fucking awkward that shit is. I'll spare you all the cringeful details of all of us trying to make the whole situation a 'normal conversation'.

Both of our mother's brought the sperm donor IDs. For those of you who don't know what that is, when a woman has received a sperm donor sample from a cryo-bank, it comes with a ID that is unique to that specific donor. Our mother's compare the IDs and... they're a match. Sarah and I were conceived from the same donor (which we had already guessed to be the case).

The rest of the night was spent discussing what to do going on. As much as I still had feelings for her, Sarah and I came to the conclusion of breaking up. We decided to go to a bi-weekly counseling therapist, to help us get past all this crap and transition into a sibling relationship.

We spent the rest of our weekend catching up with our families and headed back to uni on Monday.

As of now, 12 days later, Sarah and I are going to therapy together and we've maintained a friendly relationship, still keeping in touch throughout the week. Mentally, we're both much better but still have a long way to go. It's to early to tell, but I have hope for the future.

Q&A:

Q: When were you both conceived?

A: We were both conceived a month apart, and born 5 weeks apart.

Q: Do you guys look alike?

A: No, not really. The only thing we 'have in common' are our somewhat similar noses.

Q: What were your ancestry results?

A: Idk why this was a really common question I got through pm, but [here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/am85w9/my_results/)

Q: What town are you both from?

A: No

Q: Why do you both care? You should stay together.

A: There's no way that's happening in this society, nor do I want it to happen. We'd have to deal with social and even legal problems (depending on the state). Also, we'd run the risk of conceiving a genetically unhealthy child if we chose to have kids.

Q: Were you two able to find your biological father?

A: Sarah and I didn't match closely (in terms of 1st cousins and up) with anyone else on 23andme, and as of now, we no longer have a desire to find our bio-father. The genetic counselor mentioned we should keep an eye out for any future half-siblings taking the test.

TLDR: Confirmed incest with specialist, went back home with ex-gf/half-sister, moms confirmed the same sperm sample.

"I invited my sister out to lunch and had a discussion with her to find out the truth. I told her that the results were in and I knew something had happened between a relative of ours and she needed to tell me the truth because her daughter would find out soon enough. I manage the account and my niece has been asking me for updates around once or twice a week because it’s nearing the end of the 7 week mark since we sent the saliva samples in.

I never believed I’d be saying all of this right now, but you all were spot on. My brother is the biological father of my niece. However, it’s not the brother I mentioned in my first post.

Apparently, my parents had a son when they were teenagers and placed him for adoption. When he turned 23, he came to our house searching for his/my/our parents and they weren’t there, but my sister was. She was home from work when he came by. My sister would’ve been 18 at the time this happened and was in college, the same college he went to. They recognized one another and got close.

She did move out into her own place a few months after this happened but we thought nothing of it. They continued a relationship for a few years because they just “connected” so well (according to my sister) and that’s how my niece was conceived. He ditched her as soon as he found out she was pregnant and he hasn’t been heard from since then. He only gave our sister money for an abortion and that’s it. 

Our parents have no idea that my sister and I know that we have an older brother and I’m not sure we should inform them of this, but my sister and I plan on telling her together. I volunteered to go with her for support. Due to this, I’m certain my parents will inevitably find out that their son is the father of their daughter’s child.

What a nightmare this will become. Good vibes/prayers would be appreciated. ",55,2018-09-09 11:08:39,9e9yo1,317,The shock of a lifetime.,https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/9e9yo1/the_shock_of_a_lifetime/

"UPDATE 2: Spoke to my mom today. It was a very civil conversation. When my mom's dad died my grandma was finally free. She ended up getting a new boyfriend and basically kicked all of her kids out of the house. She asked her brother if he would take my mom in and my mom went up there to get a job. Her entire time there she worked for him but he refused to pay her though he let her live with him. He was emotionally and physically abusive to my mom and did what most manipulators do telling her she had no money , was uneducated, had no one that loved her and nowhere to go so she was pretty much stuck. It was a one time thing. He was drunk. When my mom found out she was pregnant he begged her to abort and she wouldn't. When she got the positive she tried to kill herself. She failed. She went to get an abortion and heard my heartbeat and couldn't do it. She wanted to have me, someone that was hers.  He was angry and threatened to hurt us if mom ever told anyone. He was furious she kept me. My mom tried to leave after he hurt me once, but he ended up following her. He kept my mom trapped until she finally went to college and got her degree because she was determined to start her own life and give me a good one away from her family. Before that happened he ended up dying and my mom finally got her shit together. She felt especially trapped when pregnant because she told her mom and her mother was so involved with her own life she didn't care. She told my mom that ""so what? I was offered up to my Uncle when I was little and so was my sister."" They are from Kentucky and I guess a lot of that shit was in our family. When her bf died I guess my grandma became super support mom and was like a second mom to me. My mom said she thinks it was 100% guilt and that's why grandma was super involved in my life and helped my mom get her shit together. So I guess my dad was a terrible person on other levels too. I found out I have two half sisters, but both are dead. Both are older than my mom by 4 or so years. He had the first and wanted nothing to do with her. He ended up cheating on his wife (her mom) with his brother's wife. So I guess a lot of this did go on in my family. He ended up running off with his brother's wife and impregnating her. He then also had nothing to do with that daughter and left. The first daughter became a drug addict and lost her daughter. My dad won custody of her, his granddaughter. I guess my mom ended up pretty much doing all the raising of her. She saw my mom as a mom until she eventually was of age and left and my dad had nothing to do with her either. She's also probably dead because my mom said she was also very into drugs. My mom is so ashamed and was worried I would hate her. It was something she wanted to take to the grave. This is why she lost it when she found out I got a DNA kit because she knew I'd finally learn the truth. It was such a bonding moment to talk today. My poor mother's entire life was garbage. She told me I was her driving force for living. I was what pushed her and if she wouldn't have kept me she feels like she would have been trapped until she killed herself. 

&#x200B;

Where to start. Well, I've never known my dad. When I was in 2nd grade we had to do a family tree and I was unable to add my paternal side. I always begged my mom to tell me about my dad but she wouldn't. She said it was her personal business. I did have a father figure that I called Papa. He was the second person to hold me. He was there while my mom was pregnant. He pretty much raised me and we lived with him until he died. He was my mom's uncle and she said she moved with him when she was 18 because he promised to help her get away from her abusive family and help her make a go of it. She helped him manage his career as a producer for country music. I remember he was pretty much like a dad to me. I would sit on his lap and cuddle and watch movies and he pretty much bought me anything I ever wanted. When he got Alzheimers he went downhill fast. I remember as he got worse my mother visited him less and he started saying more and more that he loved my mom and that I was his baby. My mom said he was confusing us with his ex wife and his daughter who has nothing to do with him anymore. He passed away and I never thought anything different.

&#x200B;

When my grandma had her big stroke she had told me I looked just like my dad, but stopped herself. As a side note I look just like my great uncle, her brother, and we share the same dark eyes and hair and facial features. I have his nose. She had dementia at this point and would often say things from her past that disturbed my mom. One of those times she said to my mom ""Are you ever going to tell that baby who her dad is?""

After grandma passed she confided in me she doesn't know who my dad is and that she was raped while working at a diner. She said he was Hispanic.

Not knowing my dad and wanting to know health reports for me and my son I took 23 and me and recently got my results. No hispanic at all. I was super surprised. I'm completely European. 63% Irish/British, 9% French and German, 3% Scandinavian, and the rest is broadly northwestern Europe. I found GEDMatch and out of curiosity tried the are my parents related tool. It said that my parents are related within the first 3 generations. When I took the CM and put it into DNA painter it said 100% Uncle/Aunt, Niece/Nephew, or Grandchild. My mom was 35 when she had me. Her grandpa died before she was born and her dad killed himself when she was 17. My mom has two uncles. I tried to ask my mom but she got on the defensive, begged me not to take the test, said that 23andme is fake and they don't use your DNA they just pull info about you from social media, and begged me not to talk to any of our living family. She later said I could talk to whoever I wanted because I am an adult but urged me not to. I don't want to disrespect my mom, but I really felt like I had the right to know. It changes nothing. I don't blame my mom or think less of her.

&#x200B;

So I talked to our living family, my grandma's sister's daughter. She was really uncomfortable, but said since I'm adult she'll tell me what she knows. My mom had told her that she was raped at a diner by a Mexican guy and she didn't know who he was. She had asked her mom and her mom said this was not the case. Her mom was my grandma's sister and they were super close, having even lived with each other for a short time before I was born. My grandma told her sister to keep it a secret, but their brother had raped my mom and she was pregnant with me. I was told this was a common thing in our family and a lot of that side of the family sleeps with each other.

So TLDR: TIL that my mom is actually also my cousin, my grandma is actually also my aunt, and my great uncle is also my dad. 29 years of lies uncovered by spit.",40,2019-01-01 02:58:55,aba264,260,23andme Confirmed a Suspicion,https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/aba264/23andme_confirmed_a_suspicion/
"Sorry I have no cool pictures to share, only a long ass story. I’m 33 male, Filipino-American, first generation born here in the US. 

In short, I found out that I have a half sister on 23andMe and later found out that I’m not even related to my father- maybe even my mother.

So if you want to know more, please read on:

Late last year I decided to take a DNA test for health reasons. I currently have Ulcerative Colitis, an auto-immune disorder- so I thought to myself, maybe I should take this test to see if I had any other issues I should know about. Besides that, I also thought it would be a bit interesting to see what my ancestry would be, was I really all Filipino? Or did I have maybe some Spanish in me? And how much?

Curious and interested about DNA testing I then purchased a kit, followed the instructions, spit it the tube and off went my sample.

I checked every day for my results to return on the app. Anxiously waiting for the notification. A month passed by and nothing. Almost 2 months had passed by and I started to worry, I began to think the impossible and searched the internet for answers.

After a couple hours of research I came to conclusion that this was just a part of the process, and that it could even take up to 3 months to receive results.  

I began to lose interest in the whole idea. I checked back on the results less and less. I figured I was over my head and everything would come back normal- and that the results of my ancestry- would of course show; nothing other than Filipino.

For sure 2 months, maybe 3 go by and it finally comes through. It was around dinner time at the restaurant. My chef had left already, and there I was- in charge for the night, covering service with the boys.

I pulled out my phone, opened the app and saw that my results had finally arrived. I quickly tapped on each tab to discover all the exciting information.

First was health, I scrolled down and found every bit of nonsensical information to be quite entertaining. I can smell asparagus in my urine? Cool. 50/50 chance to match musical pitch? Cool. No bald spots? K.

This was all silly to me but I found it funny. I started telling everyone at work about my results, it was a slow night- we only had a couple tables out. So the cooks were engaged.

I went over all my health reports to find out that I should be fine, according to the results and I smiled as I then tapped onto “connections”.

Ohhhh dna relatives, I thought to myself- this should be cool.

As soon as I got in though, a shocking truth was there, waiting for me- on the top of the list of relatives. “Her name” is 27.8% predicted half-sister.

I was blown away. So blown away I yelled it out loud in the kitchen. WHAT THE FUXK I HAVE A SISTER?!

Everyone in the kitchen was like shudduuupp stop messing around.

I assured them this was no joke. I showed them all the results and we all stood there amazed and confused thinking - what - the - f.

The excitement didn’t end there.

Now that I had a name of my sister, I quickly did what anybody else would do. I Facebook’d her. The first result that came up was a shock. An Asian looking girl, that looked a little younger than me, but looked a lot like me.

I showed everyone in the kitchen the picture and we all laughed and said to ourselves. Yeah right- almost like it was too easy to be true. I shrugged it off and went home.

When I got home I told my brother everything. Both of us were semi-shocked for this sister stuff to be true, but to be fair; we sorta accepted it- for we knew that my father had cheated on my mom when we were younger. It wasn’t that much of a surprise.

We decided to keep it a secret, and to find out more on our own before we approached our parents about all of this.

I ended up contacting my sister through the 23andMe app. She replied the following day. After a short conversation going back and forth we decided to get connected through Facebook. And to my surprise- it was of course- the girl- the first result that   came up on Facebook when I searched the night before.

I was blown away.

Fast forward through a lot of family drama- let’s just say I’ll save it for the movie; but my father and mother found out. 

Secrets never stay secrets.

It became a big thing, but ended with my father agreeing to take the dna test as well.

During this time my father kept saying he wasn’t the father of this girl and that he never got anyone pregnant.

He was so confident.

I was even showing him pictures of my sister’s mother. 

He’s never seen her. Never heard of her.

Nothing made sense.

I didn’t know what to believe. I just wanted to see results.

We ended up waiting about another 3 months to what happened to be just yesterday.

I sat at the table with my dad and asked if he’s received the results. He said yes and we began to log in to 23andMe on his lap top.

As I was signing in, I was thinking to myself, everything will be fine- he is the father of me and my now half-sister. 

We will get through this.

I kept thinking- we’re all related right? And I probably haven’t heard anything about the results yet because he didn’t know how to operate through this new technology.

But there I was, at the dining table, confused- wheeling up and down on the mouse, thinking to myself- this can’t be right, what the fuck.

“We could not detect identical DNA segments between you and ______”<—father

I was so confused and shocked but it didn’t really hit me at that moment.

Surely this must be some mistake, maybe we aren’t connected. Maybe there’s a mistake with privacy sharing or something.

But after going back and forth I had nothing. Everything was set right and all the notifications were up to date. Hitting the refresh button wasn’t changing anything.

My mom was there and she was confused. How could this be she exclaimed. 

All 3 of us were there just confused.

Did my mom cheat on my dad? 

No way- there’s just no way. 

I know my mom I just know she didn’t. 

I just know she doesn’t have that in her. 

And my dad? 

Well shit- why would he lie through all of this? 

Would he really try and have someone else spit for him? 

None of this made sense.

It wasn’t long till it crossed my mind.

Holy shit- what if I was switched? Could it have been possible?

Yes.

How though?

Well at birth the story is that the kid of my mother, (who we think is me), had a hole in the lungs at delivery. It was a c-section and my mother was heavily sedated. My father wasn’t even in the room.

Shortly after the pregnancy, the baby, (maybe me) was airlifted to another hospital and then put under special treatment, including an incubator.

It is there that I believe that a mix up could have occurred.

I don’t want to believe it, and can’t- but for now, it’s just the highest possibility.

In the meantime my mother has already taken a dna test and we have it sent in already. 

Hopefully it comes back quick, although I am a little scared.

I don’t even know what I’m waiting for. 

I called customer service of 23andMe already yesterday and they assured me that my sample could have not been swapped in the laboratory and told me that these tests rarely flaw in that sense.

She told me she is getting a special team to investigate the matter and will be in touch.

I’m devastated. I’m sad. I’m angry. I’m fucking confused..

My mom’s sad, my dad thinks now that she cheated on him- and I feel my brother is farther out from the family more than ever before.

So now we’re all just here waiting for more results. My brother is on stand by. And I’m just here...

What a trip-

On a brighter side, my half sister and I may have a possible lead to who our father and my mother COULD BE, she actually reached out to him, (she’s contacted numerous people with the same name that was given to her by her birth mother) but hasn’t gotten any reply.

So now we’re all here just waiting.....

If the results come back and it turns out that the hospital mixed us up- well then; they are so fucked ! 

I just can’t believe anything like this could and would happen....

I’ll take any advice u got, if you got...

"Background: I’m from a basicass white family, my dad’s side is Irish, my moms side is Italian/German. Really diverse let me tell you. This isn’t as crazy a story as some other ones I’ve read, but for my boring family, it’s pretty wild.

Anyway, I asked my parents for a 23andMe kit for Christmas, and they obliged (which made me assume there was nothing for me to discover. Slightly disheartened, I spit into the tube, sent it away, and waited. I received my results, and sat down with my parents to check it out.

My most closely-related relative was my great aunt with like 14% match - no surprise there. The second name on the list was a guy none of us had ever heard of - he was an 11% match. I just assumed one of my great uncles was a little horny and had an illegitimate kid sometime in the past - no big deal in my life or my immediate families lives.

I was so wrong. I got a message from this guy, let’s call him Gerald. Gerald hits me up and says “hey I was born and adopted in 1960. I found my bio father last year, but I think you’re related to my bio mother.” I said “oh let’s fucking go and figure this out”. So lo and behold, he is my half-uncle.

My paternal grandmother was engaged to Gerald’s bio father, and got knocked up. HOWEVER, my grandma broke off the engagement, and quickly married my grandfather.

She gave birth to Gerald in 1960 - two whole years before she had my father (who is the eldest of their children - well, he was lol). Seeing as it was 1960 and society wasn’t nearly as open as it was now, they decided to give Gerald up for adoption before continuing on with their lives.

My grandma took this to the grave with her. My grandfather died way before I was around (I was born in 1996), but my grandma only passed three years ago. My dad isn’t one to get emotional, but I could tell how shaken he was after I let him read the messages Gerald and I sent eachother and connect all the dots.

My dad’s sisters son (my cousin) is getting married this weekend, and I kinda feel bad for revealing this to them now. In hindsight they had enough to worry about with the wedding, but holy shit I am so excited that I had a secret family member literally NO ONE knew about. My aunt said she knew my grandma had a failed engagement, but had no clue about the pregnancy. Gerald’s bio father also said he had no knowledge of a pregnancy.

Fucking crazy. My dad said he’s going to talk to Gerald after the shock wears off, and I’m sure my family will welcome him with open arms. He also just ordered a test to confirm that this is the truth, but he and his sisters are all pretty much in agreement that Gerald is their half-brother. I just wish my grandma was still around to see that he’s doing very well, and that she made the right decision.

"When my grandma lived in the Middle East, she was always told her birth mom was born in Italy and her dad was temporarily married to an Italian woman. Her dad was very famous at the time and it looked bad in the 1920s that he married a non-Arab woman. They divorced after the baby was born, the mother was never allowed to see the child, and he never married again. My grandma looks very European. We said we would do a 23andme test to see if she had any ancestors out there. 

It turned out my grandma was 99% Western Asian & North African (which is unbelievable) and had only 1% European in her. 

My aunt went back to the Middle East, we did a little digging, and it turned out her dad had slept with someone out of wedlock. Due to the family’s status at the time, my grandmother’s family took the baby, and lied to my grandmother until she was 30 about who her birth mother was (she thought her stepmom was her mom her whole life). Her family covered it up. They married her to my grandpa who was from another middle eastern country who would never have known the truth of her birth and was extremely poor. They had 5 kids and they all slept in a one bedroom apartment. She never inherited from her rich father because she was a “bastard.” They told her that her dad wrote everything in his will under his sibling’s names and that she would never get a penny. It’s all very depressing. 

We haven’t had the heart to tell my grandma. She doesn’t know and luckily hasn’t remembered about the test. Hopefully, she never will.

"In this post, I will refer to my dad, the dad who raised me, as Luke. My mom was 19 and my dad (Luke) was 32 when they got married in 1988. My dad, Luke, had two sons from his first marriage, around the same age as my mom at the time. Fast forward to 1996, my parents had me when my mom was 28 and my dad was 40. 

Though my parents were married 28 years, my dad was a man who liked to keep his sexual life exciting and kept a lot of women on the side. I always joked with my brothers about how we may have a sibling from one of my dads affairs. I decided to take a 23andme test to see if I could get an answer that way. 

I received my results tonight, and saw I had a half sister who I share 24% DNA with. I called my brother excited that I had caught my dad with a whole other kid like a modern day Sherlock Holmes, to which he responded, “you need to call your mom”. 

I call my mom, and she tells me that she knew this day would come— and that my dad (Luke) was not my biological father. My dad (Luke) had a vasectomy in 1980 following the birth of my brothers from his previous marriage, and they went to a sperm bank in order to conceive me. 

It has been a wild evening, but I am feeling more loved than I have ever felt. My family has never done anything to make me think for a second that I was biologically not my fathers, I am humbled.

I had posted last week about a DNA relative found through 23 and me who I believed to be a possible half sibling. Well, long (and very emotional) story short, my dad is not my bio dad. It's been a little surreal finding this out, especially considering I'm 30 years old with a 10 year old son myself. My dad has been in my life since I was 2 months old and adopted me. I'm okay for the most part, though feeling a little wigged out if I'm being honest. Bio dad was (and apparently still is) a drug addicted dealer, and has fathered over a dozen children. Suffice it to say that I definitely lucked out with the dad who CHOSE me. Beyond all this, I have no desire for any relationship with bio father or any of the half siblings. I'm too old for that shit.",25,2019-01-08 03:59:20,adlify,227,"Update to ""I never thought it would happen to me""",https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/adlify/update_to_i_never_thought_it_would_happen_to_me/
"I posted this in a different subreddit yesterday and figured I’d update you all. 

Less than a month ago, I found out a horrible family secret I wish I wouldn’t have. My parents placed my oldest sister for adoption when they were teenagers and then once she became an adult, our dad had a child with her, who she placed for adoption. 

Since discovering this, my life has spiraled out of control. I am trying to keep my shit together, though, because I have 2 young children and a husband to consider in the midst of all of this going on. My 4 year old and 6 year old don’t understand why they can’t see their grandparents anymore and I am struggling to come up with a reason that they’d be able to understand at their ages.

My niece/half sister is a sweetheart and I feel so bad for her. The only “good” that came out of this is that she now has the answer to her question and she is in my life. Well... was. I suppose getting the answer to her “roots” question is the only good thing, and even that’s highly questionable. 

The truth about her biology and origins hurt her so badly she tried to end her own life when she found out and she is now in a psychiatric facility receiving treatment. I talked to her adoptive parents and they revealed that she was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.... all mental illnesses prominent on my father’s side of the family. I suppose having a double dose of his genes didn’t help much. I’m planning on making a trip to the facility to see her once they feel she is ready for visits and try and help her through this, maybe next month for her birthday.

I can never forgive either of my parents first and foremost for not telling my younger sister and I about our older sister. I can also truly never forgive my father for producing a child with our older sister and causing an innocent person to have health issues due to such close incest.

"So I got my 23andme Ancestry and Health reports in July. They showed what I expected - that I was primarily Irish, English, and Mexican. I found out I was a carrier for AMD, hereditary hemachromatosis, and celiac disease which didn't surprise me because of my mainly northern European heritage.

Something that did stand out to me was that I came up as ""variant not determined"" for MCAD deficiency. The fine print says that you will come up as ""variant not determined"" if there is either a mistake in the test or if you carry two variants of the gene. In MCAD deficiency, the body is deficient in an enzyme needed to breakdown fats. When the body is under stress it can't break down the fats it needs to maintain a constant energy source, so it depletes the body's glucose stores causing lethargy, seizures, coma, and death in some cases. It mainly manifests in the first few years of life when young children get ill and can't eat, but in rare cases people are asymptomatic until adulthood or never become symptomatic at all.

My dad's 23andme results came back a few weeks later and showed he was a carrier for MCAD deficiency. This is when I started to get suspicious. My ObGyn referred me to a genetic counselor, who thought it was unlikely that I had both genes for MCADD due to the low accuracy of 23andme tests but decided to test me anyway. While waiting for my official results my mom's 23andme results came back, and she is also a carrier. I passed this info on to my genetic counselor who asked me to send her both of my parent's 23andme results so the genetic testing company could make sure they were testing for the proper variants.

I just got the call two days ago that I came up positive for two copies of the k329E MCADD variant. My genetic counselor thinks that my episodic hypoglycemia is likely linked to MCADD, and she referred me to a metabolic geneticist who I have an appointment with next month. I've also never gotten severely ill, needed surgery, or fasted for an extended period of time, and my genetic counselor thinks that this is likely why I've never had metabolic crisis. I have strict instructions to go to the hospital if I get ill and can't keep food down or become lethargic, and to let my friends and family know that I carry both copies of the MCAD variant so if I become unresponsive they can pass the information on to emergency responders.

I'm really happy that I decided to pursue this and get tested. I'm supposed to get general surgery in a few months, which is a huge metabolic stressor on the body due to fasting and the physical stress of surgery. Getting surgery easily could have triggered a metabolic crisis, and 30%-50% of adults with MCADD die during their first metabolic crisis. I'll likely need to be admitted a day early for a dextrose drip to prevent any issues while fasting.

The point of this long ass post is that if anything in your genetic testing results seems weird or concerning, reach out to a genetic counselor. It could be nothing or it could be something super important that you shouldn't ignore!! Also, if you're like ""wtf is this girl talking about"" here's a link for some info on MCADD: [https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/medium-chain-acyl-coa-dehydrogenase-deficiency/](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/medium-chain-acyl-coa-dehydrogenase-deficiency/)

"Not really a family problem, but just one of those small world moments.

Background: My dad adopted me as a child, after he and my biological mother dated and had a child of their own. He is no longer with my mother, but has been my family since I was two years old. I've never known my biological father. (My mom and I know who he is/was, but he lived in Mexico and my mom lived in the United States, so they eventually lost contact.)

My dad married my step-mom a few years ago. She is of Mexican descent, and I realized her family is from a place in Mexico that is close to where my bio-dad was from. So, there is a good chance she is related to this biological father I've never met! (Although I do have some Mexican on my mom's side, so there's a slight chance there.) 

Because my step-mom is a generation above me, I suspect she's more like a fifth-cousin once removed, or something like that. And if we get into potential half-siblings and half-uncles/aunts, it gets more confusing to think about. 

Either way, it's kind of funny. My dad married someone related to the daughter he adopted. So now my dad is my in-law, I suppose.

Then I do a 23andme test - lo and behold, I have a half -sister, who is not related to those other ones. She sends me a message, asking for details, and we basically decide we are half siblings. The first family I found were not related to me.

She offers to connect me with my dad, which she then does. But she warns that he does not want his wife to know about me.

I email him, and he writes a very gruff email saying he does not want anything to do with me. He promptly deletes all his social media pages. My sister does too, and stops replying messages.

I assume that they are hiding my existence from their mum/wife.

I have lived my entire life wanting to meet my father, or even just see a photo of him. I have never seen one (he had none on social media).

I did some research and found out his home address. Would it be right to simply show up there?

"I haven't gotten my results back, but I'm really excited to see them... for one reason and one reason only...

My maternal grandmother was always extremely secretive about her family history. She had no pictures of her parents, and wold become extremely defensive - almost hostile - if anyone asked ""what are you?"". She instructed all of her kids (including my mother) to say ""We are Americans, that's all that matters, and the rest is none of your business.""

I'd really like to know what was going on there... why she wouldn't talk about it, and would get defensive when anyone asked. People would look at her and her siblings and question their ethnicity... they had light skin, but their facial features and hair gave the impression that they might be.... Black? Hispanic? Nobody could quite place them, hence the questions. Soooooo many questions. They lived in a rural Midwestern town filled with German-Americans with sandy hair and definite Aryan features, so they kind of stood out.

What were you hiding, Grandma?  :)

*** UPDATE!!!! **** I was connected with a second cousin through 23andMe who has done a lot of genelogical research on my mom's side of the family. I think I now know why my grandma was so hesitant to talk about family history. It had nothing to do with her family... it was my GRANDFATHER'S family (her husband's family).

"I never in a million years imagined I’d be saying this, but you all were right. I am the product of incest.

My biological father is also my half uncle, my mother’s older half brother. They share the same mother, which is why my X chromosome is both identical and half identical to hers. I’m assuming I inherited one of hers and the one from my father/half uncle, who shared a little bit of that X chromosome with my mother. I am female, by the way, so of course I have 2 X chromosomes. I could be wrong about how that works, so feel free to correct me if I am wrong about how the X chromosome is inherited. I am a genetics newbie after all!

My grandma was a drug addict and had all of her 4 children (only 2 had the same father, my mother and an older sister) when she was a teen. She was only 14 when she had her oldest, my half uncle/dad. She then had my half aunt at 16, then my full aunt at 17, and then finally my mother at 19. My dad/half uncle was adopted by one family, my half aunt was taken in by her paternal grandparents, and my mom and her full sister were adopted by another family. My mother admitted that once she and her half brother found each other again, they fell in love and I am the result of that. She also told me that he had a child with my full aunt, her sister.... 

Another question.... since this is the case, about how much DNA would I share with this half first cousin/full first cousin/half sibling? I am going to try and find her as well.

"In short, my sister J found out we have different biological fathers, despite having my father's name on her birth certificate. 

My parents' marriage began breaking down around when I was born, and my sister was born shortly after me. After the divorce,  my father went and had three more children. So my older three siblings and three youngest siblings all got to experience of having a father in their life and all the fatherly things that come with an involved parent. J and I, not so much. He was largely absent from our lives and major events, and we were raised by my mother. 

It didn't bother me until my sister did the DNA test and found out about her biological father. She found him and connected after 25+ years, and they've quickly made up for lost time. She now has a wonderful relationship with him, his wife, and two daughters.
 
He knew about her and we still don't understand why my father (who has since died) insisted on putting his name on the birth certificate, despite knowing J was not his daughter. My mother hasn't been to forthcoming about the whole situation, which is a story for another day.

I'm sincerely happy for her. She now has a father... even calls him dad. They talk every day, go on trips, meet for dinner. They're both overjoyed.

But it has also left me extremely hurt and jealous. I see the photos, see the joy... and I know I'll never have that relationship. Out of my seven other siblings, I'm the *only one* who doesn't have the experience of having a father in my life. J had always been my fatherless comrade of sorts, but no longer. 

I can't tell J of my jealousy, because I know it would weigh heavily on her. I don't want her to stop sharing her joy. She deserves every bit of this happiness.

"Possible Implications? I purchased the 23nme test for genetic health exploration and documentation. For myself, the results were fun and fascinating. So for Father's Day, I purchased the ancestry component for my father. . My father is 78 and is not computer savvy so I set up the account and managed it with him.  The results returned and I discovered that he and I are not related genetically. I knew that I had been a ""love child"" of the sixties. My mother had gotten pregnant while she was in college and dropped out. My parents had married after I was born. . I immediately concluded  that there had been another participant in my conception, obviously. I wasn't sure if my father knew and had chose to raise me as his own and maintain the secret, or if my mother had deceived us. My mother suffered a stroke in her early 50's when I was 31 leaving her unable to speak or write so I assumed that the opportunity to share this secret was truncated due to the stroke. I revealed the genetic information with my father.  It was an emotionally devastating. My father was shocked. he became very quiet and began to re-tell of a tragic occurrence form 54 years ago. My mother and he were very much in love and he spoke of her with such love and reverence and then cried. He explained that he had returned late from work, 6pm and wished he had returned sooner. Two men had violently raped my mother at the age of 21. He explained how wrecked she was for months and that he felt helpless and awful. My father was glad that my mother wasn't here to discover this truth and asked me to lock his account so no one that is related to him would be able to discover this information.  He had no idea that I was the result of the violation. They had been ""careful"" since they were living together, but they never considered the possibility that I was the result of the rape. 

23nme adequately warns you. Initially I found this entertaining, but the discovery that my biological father was a rapist,  elicits so many questions. I am a well educated professional that has made a positive impact on the lives around me and yet my father was an amoral individual. I admit that I am still processing this information and so is my dad.

"Hey all.

My name's Mike and I was born in Pomona, CA (Los Angeles County) in 1983 and adopted in 1984. Growing up, all I knew about my adoption was my original first name of Justin and that my mother came from out of state to have me.

My whole life, I wanted to search for my birth parents but never did for one reason or another; I didn't want to hurt or offend my (adoptive) parents, the CA court system seemed insurmountable, etc. The closest I ever got was taking a 23andMe test that my mother-in-law gave me one year for Christmas but that didn't turn up much more than a host of 3rd-to-distant cousins and multiple cold trails.

Earlier this year my dad passed away, finally joining my mother. I figured it was time to take my search seriously. I wouldn't be hurting my parents anymore by trying to find my birth parents and I didn't want to go the rest of my life with this regret so I contacted a search angel. 

The search angel I've been talking to has been wonderful. She helped me narrow down what region my parents are from via sifting through my matches on 23andMe. She looked up CA's birth registry to give me my original name of ""Justin Henderson."" (Being suitably skeptical, I didn't tell her I already knew my original first name so it was a surprise to me when she came back with that information.) We went as far as we could until it became apparent that the next step was waiting a few months to obtain my non-identifying info from the CA records system.

Then last Saturday happened. 

I got a message on 23andMe from a man named Brian. ""Hi- I think I might be your uncle."" I had to read the message over and over again, checking his profile constantly to make sure it was real. I e-mailed him back. He lives and grew up in the Great Lakes area. Turns out he has three sisters and four brothers. He knew none of his sisters had placed a child for adoption so I asked him if any of his brothers had ever dated a woman with the last name ""Henderson."" He was taken by surprise. Turns out that's his ex-sister-in-law Catherine's maiden name. 

We speak on the phone a few days later and Brian gives me his two theories.
1) His brother Dennis was married to Catherine. They got divorced and she moved out west. 
2) His brother Rick was dating one of Catherine's sisters at the time, potentially a woman named Julie although Brian couldn't remember correctly.
Brian offers to do some probing around his family and try and talk to Catherine as they're still friendly. 

That was Monday. It's Friday and I'm holding my breath right now. Here's why: Brian confirmed with one of his sisters that it was in fact Julie that Rick was dating. I found Julie's LinkedIn page and her resume places her in Los Angeles around the time of my birth. Brian got in contact with Catherine yesterday and had a brief conversation with her. 

""I took a 23andMe test and it turns out I have another nephew.""
""Oh?""
""He says his original name was Justin Henderson and he's looking for his birth mother.""
""I think I can help. But I need to talk to my sister first. I think she'll be happy that he's looking for her.""

Catherine promised to call Brian back no later than today. 

This is all too surreal and I constantly have to remind myself it's actually happening.

"So link many others, after having a DNA test (Ancestry DNA) for fun, I was contacted by people I didn't know because we had ""close"" relation based on our matching DNA.  Long story short, I'm 50 and just now found out that the dad who raised me wasn't my biological dad.  It was actually a man that my mom had an affair with (and was caught) when I was 4 years old.  My older sister is biologically the dad's that I thought we shared.  

&#x200B;

So that lets me know that when I was 4, and still married to the man I thought was my dad, she was having an affair with this married man that also got her pregnant 5 years prior.  This man had two children who are a few years older than me and did having been married to the same woman for over 30 years.  He also happened to have gotten a girl pregnant when he was in high school and that girl was put up for adoption.  

&#x200B;

Anyway, my dad passed away before I knew this and my new ""DNA"" dad is also deceased.  It was--and still is--a shock to me.  I found out less than a month ago.  I went to a counselor a few times to discuss.  I have told my children as it impacts their DNA, history, etc.  Immediately I wanted to tell my sister as we are very close, but I waited.  Right now I do not plan to tell her as, in theory, it doesn't impact her.  The parents she thought were hers still are. I'm afraid if I tell her that it will destroy her relationship with our mom who is still alive.

&#x200B;

I am very curious about this relationship, if the DNA dad knew I was his, if they had a relationship that entire time, etc.  I haven't yet told my mom.  I wonder if she has known all along and would be relieved not having to keep this secret any longer or if it would destroy her if she knew I knew.  (I have known about the affair that broke up my parents marriage since I was about 12 when my dad's wife told me about it)

&#x200B;

I spoke with my former step mom when I found out.  She said that the dad who raised me (who will ALWAYS be my dad...I will always call him my dad) suspected that I was not his.  He said I looked nothing like my sister and considered having a DNA test when that became an option.  However told her he loved me too much and it would kill him if he found out that I wasn't ""his"".  She said he asked my mom on many occasions and she insisted I was not fathered by this man (who actually was my DNA dad).  My dad even made sure, when he was diagnosed with cancer and probably terminal to drive to meet both my sister and me--he insisted he wanted to have breakfast with both of us or nothing--to tell us the news.  He very much treated us like equals and now that I know this suspicion he had makes me love him and admire him even more.

So anyway, I would love to hear from others who have talked to their mom with similar situations.  Any cautionary tales?  Any advice or wisdom?

"A while back I posted that I got surprising results from 23andme. My father always claimed to be full blooded Italian, but my results showed that I was only 1% Italian, but 48% Polish which I wasn't supposed to be at all! 

I posted on this subreddit and asked if maybe it could be that my ancestors were from Poland but spent a couple of generations in Italy. After a couple polite responses saying that it could be the case I received a 3rd that simply said, ""He's not your dad."" I hadn't even considered the possibility! But, as I thought about it it made sense.

Fast forward a couple of months (I ordered a kit from [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com) that has been sitting on my desk for quite a while. I haven't used it because I wanted to hold on to the current situation where my dad was my dad and my brothers were my brothers.) I finally talked to my older cousin who was really close to my mom her whole life. I told her the situation and she let me know that my mom was quite ""social"" when she was younger, but that she didn't know anymore. She suggested I talk to my other cousin (her brother). She called him for me and then texted me back saying that I should really talk to Chuck. I spent the night in tears fearing for my identity. Who am I? Who are my parents? Does it even freakin matter? My dad has always loved me incredibly and did till the day he died and my brothers are my brothers who I grew up with and shared my life with. Fuck!!!

Sunday morning I got the courage up to call my cousin Chuck. He cut to the chase. He informed me that my eldest brother and I were full brothers and that my 2 middle brothers (I am the youngest) were also full brothers. It turns out that back in 1965 when I was born my mother told Chuck that I was the child of my father's close friend...and, that my eldest brother was also from the same guy! So, it seems that my mother had an affair and my oldest brother was a product of that relationship, then,  had 2 children with my dad, and then hooked up with the original guy (my birth father) again and had me! It's like straight out of a bad movie! It does explain a lot though. My eldest bro and I are blond, blue eyed, academically inclined liberals, while my 2 middle bros have dark curly hair, brown eyes, are salesmen (like their father was), and are more conservative. All of our lives we always split as the oldest and youngest against the 2 middle in whatever game, situation, or interest was.

It's been a very interesting situation to say the least. I am who I am and nothing can change that, but I guess I'm going to have to do a little more research to determine if my birth father is still alive- or maybe not. I'm a bit unsure about a lot of things right now! If you decide to take the test make sure you're ready for the results!

"Before I jump to conclusions and freak out, I need some help. Things don’t look all that great for my family and I’m beginning to get anxious about the results.

I am 32, and as far as I know, I only have one sister and she is 30. I got my results back and looked through my DNA Relatives for the heck of it. I wasn’t expecting to really find any close relatives other than my first cousin who took the test, but I did. 

The very first relative listed was a woman who I’ll call AY. AY shares 55.8% of DNA with me and is predicted to be my full sister. She can’t be my full sibling, however, because her profile states she is only 18 and searching for medical history due to the fact that she was adopted. She states that she has asthma and other minor health issues and wants to know the extent of  hereditary family health problems she could expect later in life. 

I’d know if my parents had a baby when I was 14 and gave her up for adoption, obviously. My mother is 54 and my father is 55. That would put them at 36 and 37 at the time she was born. I’m trying to figure out what on earth my relation to this girl could be. 

She’s completely open sharing. We share a complete X chromosome because it is all the way across and it overlaps in two large areas, so most of our X is completely identical. We also have the majority of DNA Relatives in common but share different percentages. My (known) first cousin who took the test shares 14.1% with me, but only 6.83% with my apparent “sister.” That seems like a stretch that my first cousin could also be her first cousin since I share more than double what she does with my first cousin.

"This one is a wild ride, settle in. 

My grandma was born to Italian immigrants in NY in 1938. She never met her dad’s family because a) he was the only one who immigrated and b) his family was furious that he abandoned them, and refused to speak to him. Sadly, her dad died when she was just 14. 

My grandma was all alone. No siblings, no dad, and NO relatives in the US. The closest thing she had to family were the neighbors. She had kids later with her best friend from high school, but it was an abusive marriage that she left. Years later, she fell in love w my grandpa, and they had my mom, their first and only kid together. 

While she did go to Italy to meet her mom’s family, they lost touch in the 1990s when her mom and all her siblings died. 

I just found her dad’s brother’s grt grandson. He lives in her uncle’s old apartment. My mom cried when I showed her the message from him. He wants to meet us. My mom immediately said she wants to meet him too. She’s terrified of flying, and it’s an 8 and a half hr flight! She didn’t seem to mind. He’s my age. I’ve never had a relative my age, as my family here is like the Brady bunch, all prior marriages and half siblings. There’s a huge age gap. My cousins are in their mid-late 30s, I’m 21. My mom is 12 years younger than her sisters. 

I always felt out of place, just like my mom. Every family gathering makes me sad, knowing we are a small family because we are missing so many people. 

Because of 23andme, I found half my grandma’s family. I was also able to find the family vineyard- still run by my family. 

Because of a DNA match, I confirmed that the other half of my grandma’s family stayed in the area, and I found my grt grandma’s nephew. 

Because of another DNA match, my mom confirmed her dad’s family was from Naples, and she learned the family tradition of street magic was still going strong. 

Thank you for existing. I got my mom a 23andme kit for Christmas, and she said it was the best gift I could’ve ever given her. 

Edit: in all my excitement, I forgot to add that my mom found a cousin(my mom’s grt grandmother’s sister’s grandson) from her dad’s family. He told her stories about her great grandparents making an altar every year for the feast of St Joseph, when all the relatives would get together. This cousin was in photos we’ve had for the last 65 years. We just didn’t know it was him. ",8,2019-01-23 22:32:48,aj09cr,174,Thank you.

"Hi everyone! So I did this test almost three years ago and never had a relative over 1.96%. I was adopted, so I was a little disappointed with this. 2 weeks ago I logged in again and found an uncle. Messaged him, we talked, got in contact with my birth mother, a half sister, an aunt, and grandparents. Turns out they live 4 hours from me. It’s only been 5 days since I started talking to the family, minus the uncle, and I feel so close to them. They have all said that they have thought about and prayed for me every day. I’m going to their town next month to spend a weekend and meet them.

"I posted awhile back about my daughter's 23andme result which showed she only shared 22 segments with her father, 23 with me. Basically, she didn't share chromosome #4 with her Dad at all (and 23andme showed this).  I just heard back from the geneticist today that she has Uniparental Disomy, which is what I suspected all along. You can google it as it is complicated, but what I wanted to share most is that without 23andme, we NEVER would have found out. Because she has 2 copies of my chromosome 4, she is at risk for passing on autosomal recessive diseases to her children. So that is what we will be looking at next, it will be good information to know for when/if she has children someday.

"Throwaway here. If the truth is what I think it is, I don’t want anyone who knows my real account to see this.

Earlier this year, I purchased kits for myself, my two kids, and niece. My niece is 22 and does not know who her biological father is. My sister does, but she doesn’t want to come clean.

Our results came in a couple days ago, and I am still in complete shock. 

I share 56.7% with my niece..... there are hardly any areas where no DNA is shared. She shares over half of the X chromosome with me, and there are 2 areas on the X where it is completely identical. They say she is my sister, which is not true. I was there for her birth. I saw her come out of my sister.

My niece shares 31.4% with one of my daughters and 30.8% with my other daughter. They both show up as half sisters to my niece, which is also obviously not true. I share the normal 50% with each of my daughters of course. 

I really am hoping that my dad or his identical twin brother isn’t the father. We do have a brother, but he was only 14 at the time my niece was born and I was 18 and my sister was 22.

(Sorry for the long post) A few months ago I took the 23andme test when my best friend got it for me as a birthday gift. I didn’t think I’d be surprised by the results but he had taken it and my brother has taken the AncestryDNA test and it seemed kinda interesting so I thought I’d give it a shot. My brother got mostly Native American with some Iberian and some African as well so I thought I’d get the same. Both of my parents are Mexican. My mom is pretty light skinned and has straight hair but my dad has pretty dark skin and extremely curly hair. I have very curly hair and medium-ish/kinda dark skin as well. Because my hair and skin tone is so similar to my dad’s I never questioned that he was my father. When I got my results back I was speechless. I had less Native American than him and way more African. I went to see who my DNA matches are and I found a half brother. His DNA results showed no Native American and 82% African. He lives across the country from me in a state that my mother had never been to. I messaged him and he was just as shocked to find out about me as I was to find out about him. After talking for a while  I found out that he was originally from South Africa and moved here for work a few years ago. That’s when things started to make sense. Before I was born my mother spent a few weeks in South Africa over the summer to visit a friend of hers that was living there. I haven’t told anyone besides my best friend that got me the test about all of this. I’m don’t think my dad knows and I’m really not even sure that my mom knows considering the fact that I look similar to my dad. My half brother has told me a lot about my biological father and the rest of my biological family over there including my other two half brothers that still live in South Africa. He even gave me my bio father’s contact information. I’ve gotten to talk to his quite a bit over the past few weeks. He had no idea I existed but was really excited to know he has a daughter. My half brother is going back to visit him in about two months and they’ve mentioned that they’d like it if I came to visit so that I can meet them and the rest of by biological family. I can get the time off work and I really want to go but I still haven’t talked to my parents and I’m not really sure how I can just disappear for like two weeks without telling them where I am. I’m not really sure what to do or how to even approach the subject with my family. ,18,2019-01-14 11:28:37,afrknt,154,So I found out my dad isn’t my dad,https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/afrknt/so_i_found_out_my_dad_isnt_my_dad/

"I'll make this short and sweet. I was checking out the new (maybe just new-to-me?) map feature for finding relatives. I decided to start at my current place of residence and find out who lived the closest to me. I immediately saw a female cousin lived about 15 minutes north of me. This was a little surprising to me, so I did the natural thing and looked her up on Facebook. After only a few minutes of stalking, I was shocked to see that one of my high school friends had listed her as his grandmother! I messaged him about it and he confirmed that it was indeed his grandmother, but only by marriage. So he and I might not be related by blood, but it still feels like a pretty small world!

"This is an update to some previous posts I made in this sub. I had to remove them because unfortunately there were some privacy concerns at the time. 

I bought myself a DNA kit because I've always been interested in researching my roots.  I immediately sent it away when I received it. 

I got my results back on Christmas Eve. Cool, my ethnicity is a little different then I was expecting. But...who's this close family match at 1,455 cM?!?  

I started digging and realized that this looked like it was way more likely to be a full uncle from my father's side. (this match didn't share any of my known close maternal matches).  

Me and my father went over all of the scenarios about a million times. We he adopted? Why was his birth certificate changed after he was born? Who is this unknown match? Did my grandparents give up a child? 

I did some Facebook digging and was able to find the unknown match. Turns out, he lives less then 5 minutes from where I've lived my whole life. He looks strangely like my dad. It also turns out that he has a sister. Their last name sounds familiar. *take note of this.  

The unknown matches father died years ago but he also looked strangely like my father. We could figure this all out through Google, Facebook and obituary searches. At this point we promptly bought my dad a kit. We were still questioning whether my dad was adopted due to me sharing near full uncle/nephew relationship levels of DNA with this unknown match. 

On 1/24 or so, my father's results finally came back. It showed that this unknown match was much more likely to be a half brother to my father

We found maternal matches but could not locate any paternal - instead we found matches that shared the same last name as the unknown match. 

We prodded around my family. My 86 year old Grandmother said that these DNA kits aren't accurate and that my Grandfather was who I always thought he was. (I never met him). 

Finally...one of my aunt's fessed up. She told my father that there was a period where my grandmother left my grandfather. When they got back together, she was pregnant with my dad. My grandfather knew it and argued that it was not his child. But they went on anyway until he died in 1994. My father is now 52 and is just now getting the truth.  His biological father is not who he grew up around.

We don't know if my grandmother knows and is just in denial, if she's ashamed, or if she truly just wasn't sure - were just gonna leave it be for now.  

*What's most notable about all of this. I recognized the last name of the unknown match. That's because I knew his sister. (My newly discovered half aunt?).  I very briefly dated her daughter in highschool. I went to a cookout or two. It was nothing serious and we were super young - but it's pretty much been confirmed at this point that she is my half cousin.

I basically met all of my half cousins and my half aunt without ever even knowing their grandfather was also my grandfather!  I may have even met him and just can't remember it because it was a decade ago. 

The only real depressing part of all of this, I never knew my now actual biological gandfather. He died in 2014.  So close but this has been crazy....

All of them responded to my message I sent. They were all thrilled to hear from me, especially my father! I found out some things that are pretty exciting.

They’d all eventually like to meet me. My maternal half sister and brother (they’re full blooded siblings to one another) did the test because our mother was recently diagnosed with cancer and she wanted to meet me and talk to me before she passed. She got clean from her drug addiction, met a guy and married him and then had both of my siblings. 

My bio father told me that he also got cleaned up and is married. One of the half siblings from his side is actually older than me. She was shocked to hear that there was another offspring from him and wants to meet me. He had her with another woman before he got with my bio mother. The other two were eager to meet me as well once they found out about me, which is a relief. I have added all of them as friends on Facebook and things are going swimmingly so far. I even look like a good combo of both sides! I have my father’s blue eyes (I suspect from the Scandinavian ancestry!) and my mother’s wavy hair.

My maternal half brother has volunteered to purchase a plane ticket for me to come meet them as well as their families. I’m an aunt on both sides of the family and I’m so excited! I’ve always wanted to be an aunt! I was raised an only child by my adoptive parents so that has never been a possibility until now.

"It was around my fourth birthday that I asked my mom when I would get a younger sibling. 

Up until that point I had two cousins, my older cousin Michelle and my younger cousin Jessica. I had always been surrounded by only children but all of a sudden Jessica was about to be a big sister. Her brother Joe was born a little over a month before my birthday and all I wanted next was a brother or sister of my own. 

Unfortunately that would never happen. My parents had tried to get pregnant time and again and when one heartbreak was too many they turned towards adoption. Asking for a sibling led to a conversation that must have been incredibly difficult for my parents but it happened, they broke the news, and I grew up knowing the truth. 

Or as much of the truth as was possible. 

My adoption was closed. I had very little information about the first nine months of my life other than my place of birth, my original name, and scant details about my birth mother hidden away on hand\-written notes in envelopes sent by the foster home and buried in the back of my father’s filing cabinet. 

Finding my birth family had always been something I kept just out of my own reach. As my mother got sick, as my dad fought depression, I didn’t want to disturb the few moments of peace we had. As I grew older and more curious, I never asked them for details around my adoption because I never wanted them to feel like they weren’t good enough. I was afraid they’d feel like I was looking to replace them. 

This great, big, defining mystery of my life became something buried in the back of my mind that would come out when curiosity got the best of me. All too often, I would come right up to the line of beginning a real, honest\-to\-God search for my birth family before letting the desire wash away again. I would fill out the appropriate paperwork to petition to unseal my birth records only to get cold feet and never file. I joined 23andMe only to wonder if any of the fourth cousins I was matched with would ever lead anywhere. But above all else, I would ignore the gnawing inside me because as an adoptee I’d learned to cherish stability above all else and I was comfortable in simply not knowing.

It wasn't until this year, after my father passed away, that I began taking the idea of finding my birth family seriously. With both of my parents gone and having recently binged two seasons of This Is Us in all of its adoption\-positive glory, I found myself standing in the shadow of what I believed to be an insurmountable bureaucracy between myself and the truth.

A few days before Easter, my Aunt Fran asked me if anything had ever come of the DNA test I did. I told her about the cold trails and unhelpful cousins. I wasn’t sure but I thought I could see a hint of disappointment on her face. The day before Easter, I received a message via 23andMe.

“Hi\-\- I think I might be your uncle.” 

I read this message as I stepped out for my lunch break. A man named Brian had just gotten his results and it listed me as a possible nephew. The message contained his e\-mail address and an invitation to contact him. I was flooded with adrenaline as I drove to Chipotle. My heart felt like it was going to punch its way out of my chest and I may or may not have run a red light as I pored over his message. I typed and re\-typed and re\-typed a reply over a barbacoa burrito, no beans, with a Diet Coke. We e\-mailed back and forth throughout the rest of the day and made plans to speak on the phone on Monday. 

I went home to tell the story to Noelle. “I’ve got something that I need to tell you, but I really need you to not make a big deal out of this…”

Monday came and Brian and I spoke on the phone. He told me the story of opening his results from 23andMe and how he began to share the news with a small circle of his large family. He shared his theories on who my parents could be; Two of his brothers had been involved with a pair of sisters who shared my original last name of Henderson. He offered to do the detective work of figuring out which of his brothers was my biological father and which of the sisters was my mother.

That night, Noelle and I went to dinner. I filled her in on the day’s conversation and showed her a photo of Brian. She almost fell out of her chair when she saw the resemblance between us. We spent a majority of that evening on Facebook, creeping on the profiles of Brian’s family members and the women we believed could be my mother.

Over the course of the next two weeks, Brian made the right connections and asked the right questions. We confirmed who my mother was and in turn which of Brian's brothers was my father. My birth mother needed some time to process everything and, with Brian as the surrogate between us all, agreed that she would contact me when she was ready and in turn Brian would break the news to my birth father. 

Throughout all of this, I had told but one member of my family; my cousin Michelle, Fran’s daughter. I called her a few nights after I had first spoken to Brian. “Hey. I have something that I need to tell the family but I don’t know how to yet but I need to tell someone so I’m swearing you to secrecy, okay?” Our moms were twins, making her the closest thing to a sister I ever had. As private a person as I am, I figured if Michelle was the one I could trust that one time I got arrested, she was the one I could tell about this huge, life\-changing news. She assured me that when the time came, our family would be understanding and supportive.

On Wednesday, April 18, I was heading into work early when I got a notification from Facebook. “Hello, my name is Julie Henderson. I think you might be looking for me.” This was how the first message I received from my birth mother began. Our first phone call was later that day.

“I don’t even know how to start this conversation,” I began with a chuckle.
“Why don’t you start by telling me what you had for lunch.”

We began in the shallow end before wading into deeper territory. We talked about the weather, work, LA traffic. Then we got a little heavier; What was my childhood like? Did I go to church? Did I ever try to open my birth records when I turned eighteen? I told her about all the reasons I was afraid to go down that rabbit\-hole in my youth and she told me that if I opened my birth records I would have found a letter she wrote to me detailing how I to find her if I chose to. In that moment, I fought back tears thinking of how hard it must have been for her to wonder over the last seventeen years if I had opened my records or cared to find her. I ran ten minutes late on my lunch talking to her and, truthfully, I could have gone hours more. 

Over the next few days, Julie broke the news to her daughter Erin, my sister. That Saturday, Brian made the drive up to his brother Rick to tell him that he has a son. Word made its way though the grapevine to Rick’s daughter Lindsey, and like that I had a second sister. Aunts and cousins left and right began to reach out and before long Noelle and I were making plans to travel up to Michigan to meet all of these people this summer and all the way up until today I still hadn’t told any family other than Michelle.

We went to dinner with my Aunt Fran and Uncle Eddie tonight. I came prepared. I had rehearsed the story in my mind all day. I had an album on my phone of pictures to show them and when the moment was right, when I had ordered a drink to steady my nerves, I began.

“Remember about a month ago when you asked me if anything ever came of that 23andMe test?” I handed my phone to Fran so she could read that first message Brian had sent me. I told the story of the last month, I shared pictures, and Noelle swears she saw Eddie get misty\-eyed at the resemblance between me and Brian. They joked at the idea of Noelle and I needing to buy Christmas cards in bulk and wondered if Julie or anybody else would ever come visit us out here. 

I’m pushing 1600 words here and I feel like I’ve barely scratched this story. There’s still a lot to process and this story is definitely not over, so I’m not going to try and give this post an ending. Instead, I’ll finish with this. My biggest fear in tackling this mystery was always the idea that anybody would feel like I was trying to replace them. I knew it would all be okay when this happened at dinner.

“Doesn’t it feel good to know you have family out there?” Fran asked.
Eddie jumped in, “Well, you always had a family. You still have a family. Now you just have a lot more of them.”",15,2018-05-06 15:41:50,8hdr6p,137,Update: 23andMe and finding my birth family,https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/8hdr6p/update_23andme_and_finding_my_birth_family/

Short answer:  he replied and he seems excited to hear from her, he knew he was born from donated egg.  They are emailing.  Not sure yet what future holds for meeting and if the FB profile we found was the right one, but it looks like they’ll definitely be in touch and exchanging lots of info.",6,2018-07-25 19:42:43,91r36m,137,Update: we have a reply from my wife’s donated-egg son,https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/91r36m/update_we_have_a_reply_from_my_wifes_donatedegg/
